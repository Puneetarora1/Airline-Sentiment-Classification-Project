    "# **Data Description**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline.\n",
    "- Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as \"late flight\" or \"rude service\").\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project is from a dataset from Kaggle.\n",
    "- Link to the Kaggle project site:https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment\n",
    "- The dataset has to be downloaded from the above Kagglewebsite.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To classify the sentiment of tweets into the positive, neutral & negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Learning Outcomes**:\n",
    "- Text based EDA\n",
    "- Basic understanding of text pre-processing.\n",
    "- What to do after text pre-processing:\n",
    "    - Bag of words\n",
    "    - Tf-idf\n",
    "- Build the classification model.\n",
    "- Tune & Evaluate the Model performance.\n",

Well, I didn\\'t…but NOW I DO! it was amazing, and arrived an hour early. You\\'re too good to me. did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24 I pretty graphics. so much better than minimal iconography. This is such a great deal!

SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA. So excited for my first cross country flight LAX to MCO I\\'ve heard nothing but great things about Virgin America. #29DaysToGo I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn\\'t fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP! I ❤️ flying ☺️👍 you know what would be amazingly awesome? BOS-FLL PLEASE!!!!!!! I want to fly with only you. why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select??? I love this graphic. I love the hipster innovation. You are a feel good brand. will you be making BOS&gt;LAS non stop permanently anytime soon? you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... 😡 I want free internet status match program. I applied and it\\'s been three weeks. Called and emailed with no response. What happened 2 ur vegan food options?! At least say on ur site so i know I won\\'t be able 2 eat anything for next 6 hrs #fail do you miss me? Don\\'t worry we\\'ll be together very soon. amazing to me that we can\\'t get any cold air from the vents. #VX358 #noair #worstflightever #roasted #SFOtoBOS LAX to EWR - Middle seat on a red eye. Such a noob maneuver. #sendambien #andchexmix hi! I just bked a cool birthday trip with you, but i can\\'t add my elevate no. cause i entered my middle name during Flight Booking Problems 😢 Are the hours of operation for the Club at SFO that are posted online current? help, left expensive headphones on flight 89 IAD to LAX today. Seat 2A. No one answering L&amp;F number at LAX! awaiting my return phone call, just would prefer to use your online self-service option this is great news! America could start flights to Hawaii by end of year via Nice Vibe with the moodlight from takeoff to touchdown. #MoodlitMonday #ScienceBehindTheExperience Moodlighting is the only way to fly! Best experience EVER! Cool and calming. 💜✈ #MoodlitMonday Done and done! Best airline around, hands down! when can I book my flight to Hawaii?? Your chat support is not working on your site: View of downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood Sign, and beyond that rain in the mountains! Hey, first time flyer next week - excited! But I\\'m having a hard time getting my flights added to my Elevate account. Help? plz help me win my bid upgrade for my flight 2/27 LAX---&gt;SEA!!! 🍷👍💺✈️ I have an unused ticket but moved to a new city where you don\\'t fly.

DREAM wow this just blew my mind After last night #tribute #SoundOfMusic #Oscars2015 I think agree All were entertaining Is flight 769 on it\\'s way? Was supposed to take off 30 minutes ago. Website still shows \"On Time\" not \"In Flight\". Thanks. Julie Andrews all the way though was very impressive! NO to wish you flew out of Atlanta... Soon? Julie Andrews. Hands down. Will flights be leaving Dallas for LA on February 24th? hi! i\\'m so excited about your $99 LGA-&gt;DAL deal- but i\\'ve been trying 2 book since last week the page never loads. thx! you know it.

The was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture But thanks for asking Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it. Yes. Doesn\\'t make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn\\'t change the fact that I\\'m very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight. I\\'m constantly having challenges with upgrades charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came.

Phone number please. Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at ... Going to miss my ride at help please! #HelpImStuck #United it\\'s highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear \\'call corp\\' man I can\\'t wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you\\'re a life sabe Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline city tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let\\'s find these bags. better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible \"provide a death certificate\\' policy Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn? My post was just more of disappointment. I\\'m a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??. 1 bad apple doesn\\'t spoil the bunch. you guys continue to impress me in Houston. I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you! Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation. question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where? Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW! thanks for effing up our holidays - we\\'re missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team\\'s incompetence at Twitter isn\\'t letting me DM you.. I hope so too agent helps the person in front of me. Finishes up with them and then walks away. The guy behind me is as shocked as I am. Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous. Not encouraged that I\\'ll have my CPAP tonight. Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier. Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies?? Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it\\'s on time again with 20 min to spare? Don\\'t say it\\'s delayed unless you\\'re sure! yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD. where is my flight voucher? Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let\\'s not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable. has once again let me down. Don\\'t think I\\'ve ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period. yes I filed a claim hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep no reimbursement. UA938 ORD-LHR. bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet! Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack? After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich. spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked. Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave. Can you help? so that\\'s it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this! Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! 🙌 #StatusMatchPaidOff not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA Thanks for the reminder. It\\'s been a fun ride. I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I\\'m asking for all 50 people to be refunded. updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don\\'t get it. How can I charge devices? was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going 5 gate changes, two delays. Even the crew thinks the airline sucks I\\'m very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures. computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That\\'s just ridiculous keep people updated! Soooo, it\\'s been 15 days and you\\'ve offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now? Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver. Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2) It\\'s taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update? I appreciate your efforts getting me home! That\\'s correct—I\\'ve spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2) Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers. what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas? UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful. system failure again = bad trend. Software projects are like flying an airplane; there\\'s no such thing as an emergency takeoff. lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour. rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need as I\\'m tired of sitting on planes despite shaky connections, looks like I\\'ll get home tonight. Great job, - was touch and go for a while.. however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago. can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased? comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board GRK13575M is the file reference we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot! UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably. Been trying since 1230 to file a report. I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response. Yet another reason why I\\'ll never fly with you again. My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it? here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it\\'s illegal to use a used car seat thank you. Decisions Decisions We\\'d love for you to try our service. We offer status match too. ^KP” Need more info on that! We have great amenity kits. PJ\\'s not included.

Is there compensation or anything that can be done? “@united: The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see ^JP” what\\'s the point of membership? wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime Dmed you. Thank you thanks we\\'ll be in touch! Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service! Found my daughter\\'s bag lost on UA1516. Made her day! 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin? Don\\'t see any days in March? like continental\\'s chicken feat fairs can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am? I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me. how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh. caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you\\'ve lost it at O\\'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating! Yes!! Thanks so much!!! 💜“@united: We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they\\'ve reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY” captain \"on behalf of the front office, welcome on board.\".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard. #funnycaptain Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag? to be clear on my luggage comment, I am referencing the photo attached.

Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow. how is Mexico not international from the us? diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it\\'s way to MSY. If you only had people that cared Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can\\'t help rebook. #friendlyskies? we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies?? landed in Boston at 9 last night. The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho. FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS Just sent thank u Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH. so what’s the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example. thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle. i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise. now what?!? flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That\\'s how would handle. your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ✈️ So you are inadequate by accident? Denver International Airport Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can\\'t help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies ...and when that doesn\\'t work... did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn\\'t find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play. Earn miles but can\\'t use them. flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags. That\\'s not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag\\'s location is. what\\'s a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl\\'s trip stat?! thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ❄️❄️ still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning. or has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of has said nothing. cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in and exp the worst flight ever! I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled? I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened. Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That\\'s the experience I\\'m used to. Opened the app to find flight changed. that is not in line with your responses here. And now I\\'m waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked. I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change your helpful agents in Club helped. I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with never heard of this? doesn\\'t charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious \"costs\" that you incur, Exhausted frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I\\'m not a rookie. Read my bio. that\\'s exactly the point. It fits. I\\'m premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I\\'ve been doing this for 15 yrs I\\'ve never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc. fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY. Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage\\'s lost and there\\'s no help but argument! should NOT sell tickets for on has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry. Thank you! When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks. My favorite way to travel! Thank you! yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets? but if i tweet the ID number, won\\'t that reveal my home address to anyone on the web? I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere! the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse. i hope this is the last time i \"have\" to fly with you. thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472 I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on I did... no response back this is atrocious customer service. will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares. vía #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why? THAT\\'S your response? Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology thanks! It\\'s 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff? of course I did. The bag should be here by now #frustrated you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague. is the worst airline in the world. someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management. Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry. I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited I will but right now I\\'m to angry first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to #CommunicationFail the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair I\\'m saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time lots of frustrated flyers standing around I think DM would be better gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft tell the truth! you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone\\'s personal possessions you couldn\\'t care less!.... how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive.. once united\\'s service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again really? Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?! Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable done Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so. has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude. found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines. Nope. Walked up down the ORF terminal, not a United agent to be found. Showed up last minute to board us. Many panicked people thank you by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper. I\\'m trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted. that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine! he has no priority and Iove it Pleased to be a Premier Platinum how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter. hahaha. If they weren\\'t an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!! i think he actually did not like your screen 😃😃😃 Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?! It\\'s a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David. Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim. It is going on 2 months with no attention to this? We are very upset. my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help? #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN. Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement. Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can\\'t be placed in 2000 characters? Thank you “@united: I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH” In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff? thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd. We\\'ve been waiting on tarmac for because apparently UA1116 is overweight we returned to gate. #WTF #fb Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked. Can\\'t leave the Tarmac ..united\\'s gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited That\\'s real dedication concern. Your apologies don\\'t fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I\\'ve had over the past 6 mos. blocked me from DM\\'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback. Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile! I will, as soon as I am done with my article. Thanks! ~Tom booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can\\'t redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere. We\\'ve had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that? pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible. Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn\\'t ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out. is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I\\'ve never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass. I\\'m rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep. .@united For those playing along at home: yes, they said it took more than an hour! those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder. Ok thank again for your help! Not a happy flyer. UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland. Sunday 2/22. Stay tuned for blog article from Thanks had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366 flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time. thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back. 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns Heads up We didn\\'t check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren\\'t claim #s for our 2. Other people\\'s bags? This must be a drone “@united: We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you...\" Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though. flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them. Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted. well that\\'s big of you but I don\\'t have terribly high expectations at this point. it\\'s like you\\'re trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that\\'s never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿 nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather. Pilot says waiting on fuel. One in ur control, one not Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work. Huge thanks. Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I\\'ll have to stay overnight? I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired. really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, you boarded us, sent us back up, boarded us again. Won\\'t change our flight. Can we go now? that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just \"activate\" it and surf... I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap Nope - still no one helped me. Giving up on united. #badservice 8602947, jon at thanks. when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up. I\\'d thank you - but you didn\\'t help. taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn\\'t actually helpful Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven\\'t left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse? I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles! 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? But I don\\'t see AA Did you find out where it is? Thanks On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence. yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight! Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day! #missedWork #clientNotHappy thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above beyond to get my stranded family home. don\\'t see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn\\'t broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes? look at this beauty 😉 dc 10 united airlines 😉 Thanks! I\\'ll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don\\'t like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback will be better this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don\\'t understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent. 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now? of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are I wasn\\'t asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit flight was scheduled for 11:56, it\\'s 1:05 and we haven\\'t moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense ok thx! I can\\'t DM you so here\\'s the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you go to hell since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don\\'t u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed Definitely will! Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights 18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations. Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO! great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now. counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou The saga of the bag delay w/ - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned. Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I\\'ve used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable! thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up. why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse that\\'s brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon? what gate is ua5396 leaving from? thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me we\\'ve been here since 3am and you\\'ve Cancelled Flightled our flight twice no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396 UA5396 can wait for me. I\\'m on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap. from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I\\'m getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK fails again. saves the day. better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight is there a United gold number? I\\'ve been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help. Great! I\\'m ready to go home. wow you even answered back! Awesome! That\\'s customer service!!! #usairwaysfail It\\'s not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on? noooooooooooooooooooooope. Oh, we are sure it\\'s not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it\\'s usually the only YYJ flight that\\'s Cancelled Flightled daily. outsource it all United Airlines...your customers are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource. Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV? Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can\\'t DM you. X it\\'s not getting any better. I\\'d suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi. Just sent! Thanks already missed connection ugh sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft. How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding I now lost my bag. Help! there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info. flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We\\'re on the outdoor track for an hour - SERIOUSLY it\\'s 2015?!?! NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589. You\\'re the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no \\'unwind\\' BS. u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight. #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again you\\'re the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare what a pointless tweet. At least asked me to follow them to try and resolve that\\'s not even an apology that\\'s cool - now what? - SERIOUSLY it\\'s 2015?!?! NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589. You\\'re the ONLY airline without WiFi... b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight?? #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20? ORD ABQ 3709. I can\\'t even take a walk without missing a change. Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine. hahaha. At least they gave u a refund. your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother? and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status on an airline that\\'s unsafe? STUNNING How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation? Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane, the Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back! In 2015, United is \"unable\" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981 been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can\\'t figure it out! awesome service... NOT! You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake! last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to \"sick pilot\". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care. only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I\\'m a mileage plus card member 😔 We\\'re hoping to hear from you actually. shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for \"maintenance\" it could be the same issue 2day It\\'s the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what\\'s going on other than \"maintenance\". b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best. The problem isn\\'t a Cancelled Flightled a flight. a) she\\'s an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out. sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven\\'t. thank you very much for the help. We\\'re do I pick up my bags aspen airport are they coming in today on flight911 gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight board I\\'d say most of the public can\\'t extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can\\'t honor? Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. \"No crew\".Tells wife 4 yr old to \"get to NY to catch to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead. Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don\\'t believe verbal or written confirmations from United BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight. Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don\\'t have an electronic ticket 1.75 hour delay. Nothing says sorry like a voucher. Missing time with family. #family #precioustime After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation.. has two whole people trying to schedule a flight\\'s worth of missed connections. Shameful is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt gate agent at EWR \" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it\\'s time to board, please step\". STEP UP??? Lol it won\\'t help...been there done that. forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals would love help getting there today. In #EWR now. Will take any airline and connections. Thx today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt. thank you! Thanks for the update. and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too? ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter\\'s flt?? What\\'s going on? Follow me so I can dm details. Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again). #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours? just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won\\'t be missed now was that English? I\\'ll DM though I don\\'t think you\\'ll make a plane appear. looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? Air why don\\'t you fly to SBA? 😭 sitting in a plane with no pilot. Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner. already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we\\'re very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h? received hotel but no food. Also email for 3750 miles. Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation? Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I\\'ve already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines follow back and I\\'ll give you the details. and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!! The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting! Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once. switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!! traveling with who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior #UnitedAirlines how long will1531 be delayed. Why isn\\'t the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? knows better.. i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help! you suck. 9 hour delay?! you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down. scott, need a good book suggestion? JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes. 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed! please see dm!! Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn\\'t police the overhead bins? Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won\\'t be able take wet clothes to the airport AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN\\'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER! still no response?? 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me There is no \"reference number.\" Your agent told me to \"just drive to the airport\" because \"I can\\'t reach anyone there to deliver...\" Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops. My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you. my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed? Thanks! 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives? is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, you\\'re not that bad! I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!! I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr? no they aren\\'t - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines) been solved, they finally picked up the second time I called, thanks for the response JH! 7:21 to dulles works! need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants. space. Doctors\\' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united \\'s new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead epic fail. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac! at the gate! IAD to RDU thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule... to operated #B767-300ER from #Newark to #Zurich replacing B767-400ER between 6MAY-23SEP instead till 23OCT #avgeek 2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag!

Thank you for your response! Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone. Beyond frustrated Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover. Of course only seats are $$++. Cust svc no help working with Lisa J at ORD. she\\'s working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR. love the new 1st class breakfast! i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I\\'m still irritated w/ united. flight Cancelled Flightled, and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I\\'d be fine with DCA or IAD, just arriving earlier! Help! so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking? I am not finding the humor. Left item n the seatback on UA1260. Is there any way to call DCA to ask if they have the item? Already submitted lost found report at this point I made it home on my own. I DM\\'d child\\'s birthdate and full name. Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again! I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go. J you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I\\'m at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place. it wasn\\'t a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response Lisa J is amazing the guy not so much. you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that\\'s it! We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR flew from sdf to ATL to Tampa on Delta. Left early. Arrived early. Crew helpful. Wifi worked!! two years old. Birthdate 11/13/2012 how about starting without the robotic response? I already did. You can\\'t control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here. Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I\\'ve ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck. yes, but it\\'s not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500 what would it cost I\\'m on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService Cool. Thank you. I\\'ve got a campus visit in an hour and I\\'m still wearing the same clothes... Adopting 2 yr old child from Ethiopia. Flying from ADD to GRR on 2/28. Need to add child to reservation and get costs. Help! Thx I\\'d like to thank and recognize Terri P at Dulles for going out of her way to get me back on my Raleigh flight as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. #ServiceFail good morning, any first class upgrades available for ua1619 Feb 25 rsw to ewr? I need 4 seats please day 3 of this Saga maybe they\\'ll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice No, thanks. I\\'m sick of your company\\'s lousy excuse for customer service. I\\'m never flying United again. current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long why not make this option available online? I understand ppl make mistakes but don\\'t code something in a way that we can\\'t get reimbursed when it\\'s YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection. jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it\\'s our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy .@united Not what\\'s been shared by the pilot with passengers! WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat? WTF. they\\'re not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful. I\\'m not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse! wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn\\'t work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US? .@united You may \"dislike delays\" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time. #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay DM sent as requested. Make sure you follow back so you can DM me back. Thanks I\\'m aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit please help Making sure your flights aren\\'t delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start. hilarious hahahahaha ya tried that already WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding? Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass? \"Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages.\" funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son wasn\\'t trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee unhappy with your new mileage rules - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly again. you\\'ve been officially displaced by for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching! sitting in the middle for the first time .. Hope it works out well you need a bag bouncer. Get it together and learn how to book flights. what is going on with United\\'s Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit? you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool. UA3388 was Cancelled Flightled not delayed. Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home. At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation. never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight Was able to send the DM. All good now. three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats... and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it\\'s fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly - it\\'s been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end? Thanks. Got it straightend out last night. well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight any chance flight 3745 is being delayed?? nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending. no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with. I guess you have to \"follow\" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won\\'t send. Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now. Stopped flying 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked? - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3? just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage? why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to \"check in\" at counter? #fuckinlame very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight. an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever hi -- was. Thank you! an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff - 75% of a plane\\'s passengers boarding in your \"Premier\" groups might be an indication of a broken process. Any news about the departure of the flight UA51? EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to you😊 Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it\\'s totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it\\'s Cancelled Flightled, again. changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days no change yet flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919. Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please. literally sucks thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable. this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really? really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket yes please. Going to drive the 6 hours. I am impressed with your super-fast reply to hi JP, with the help of an awesome TSA representative, I was able to get it all taken care of. Thank you! First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised.... Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting? please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable the child is two years old it\\'s 430am and wife still doesn\\'t have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM? followed you and DM\\'d you the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air. you are terrible. United 787 in snowy Denver. I\\'m glad you didn\\'t mean to, but it doesn\\'t excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a \\'error\\' message. I hope you didn\\'t still charge me. … But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power lifevests on the floor #UA992 … Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.) on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too. can you help me add my KTN to this reservation PLZ? aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won\\'t be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how\\'s that for patience? whats UA 1205 lax - newark ?? ual sucks not happening. Delta took care of us. Peace! BUT just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (\"uplink prob\"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate? you\\'ll be hearing from me for sure. so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United Yes I did. We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you. Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage. In Ethiopia adopting a child. Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation) after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You\\'re the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service! doesn\\'t help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight. 40 minutes on tarmac now. That\\'s after 9 hour delay. I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER????????? One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone language was very unprofessional. that\\'s why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons I wanna be grand staff SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why... that\\'s why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate also didn\\'t ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs. your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn\\'t have a gate agent once we got a gate. I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That\\'s how much they value my time?? checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving? Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher? If you consider 50 mins for bags 10:00pm on a Sunday night \"as fast as they can\", you should reconsider what you think that means. It\\'s the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United why do you want me to be loyal if don\\'t let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I\\'m Group 2, overhead bins are empty On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach. Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck. Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever Not to belabor my point,but shouldn\\'t I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat? Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment? even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded I\\'m desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight. #unacceptable #ORD Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip. Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn\\'t that my choice? How about all gate checked? Thx you\\'re my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016 bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info. You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it! was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky will lose my bag but won\\'t give me free pretzels #frauds you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved! typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century! is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor?? customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold. was forced to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic love how you don\\'t give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I\\'ve stayed away tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error). it will be on a different airline. and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved. clicked \"upgrade now\" and it didn\\'t upgrade. What gives? you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can\\'t be book. spent over 2 hours with united support tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can\\'t be book! I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed? quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? How do I get through to finally board UA 1534? yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around. Flight 472 from ORD couldn\\'t let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. i need help but in spanish A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn\\'t wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them? with the exception of everything you\\'ve asked for. Heh UA1731 - Denver to Austin... Still on the ground... either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight... UA1469. Just landed. considering it. Currently gold on Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore? flight 435 worst flights I\\'ve ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN customers aren\\'t dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers bull crap. I spent $600 on a recent trip. That\\'s not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles. Would have only been 6600 UA yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier compensate us for new clothes bet you won\\'t I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks let\\'s make some good memories! we\\'re stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =) yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams I tried the online tracking and they said something like \"attempting to locate luggage\" your worker told us not to call because we\\'d be talking to someone in Thailand... - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven\\'t received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here. is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground. #liars #united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus? you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections if you don\\'t like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much? the delay is due to customer service for 20 people? What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+? #FlightFail #Hour20Delay he is so excellent and so reliable #happycustomer but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read \\'ya we\\'ll change that so our customers get better service\\' She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow Hi. My relative\\'s Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4. Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia. Thank you it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep! really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc. to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business. Why have airlines always told us they can\\'t open a cabin door once it has been closed? This plane has done it 3 times tonight. “@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote I can\\'t find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight? Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn\\'t address the issue! thank you! that\\'s not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed. Why is my time less important to you? #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice I did. It took about an hour and a half though Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =( WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations. Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn\\'t let us on. time to give up my 1K status and switch to - you are so terrible I can\\'t even describe. Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per same tail number as #UA5525 You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won\\'t let us on even though it\\'s at the gate. #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent. many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can\\'t find an empty gate? You\\'re trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant. we\\'ve been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free. Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing \"delayed due to customer service\" Huh? what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That\\'s it??? except all of that delayed the flight anyway. maybe find a different gate #ua1758 I sent a message. It\\'s very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt? wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we\\'re hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations. Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative. Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability? I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn\\'t an option. What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow? rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It\\'s now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484 on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow. not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can\\'t use their overhead space... is so cheap they couldn\\'t afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he\\'s stuck at Tarmac misses connecting flight always Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O\\'Hare in Chicago. sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors. UAL is incompetent on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas? take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain\\'t cool, yo. bummer but thank you for the quick response I didn\\'t have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn\\'t going to pay for another cab to do so. didn\\'t realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow. You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I\\'d like to speak to someone about it. I\\'m really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there. so glad I\\'ve been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever. we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep. They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes Thanks for the attentiveness! lol too little too Late Flight yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin? Pls start charging. please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins. Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let\\'s see how you compare to the garbage first class has become your seats are god awful. good try but got her here safer and sooner Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled. 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed! Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can\\'t do both. Can you help? I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I\\'m providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me? I\\'m on UA1118 and my direct tv isn\\'t working. How do I avoid this in future? is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don\\'t believe gate agent that overhead is full; don\\'t reserve aisle i sure will on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it any options to cos tonight? Doesn\\'t look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room? Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s. S/O to for coming in clutch and finally taking me home 🙌🙌 customer service sucks! They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes. JP - DM message who? Can\\'t get a DM through to strikes again! Why board anyone if there\\'s something wrong with the plane? Common sense. thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21. Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting. Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD??? left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY! social media team is on point on #OscarNight always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence is the airline of the Oscars but doesn\\'t carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can\\'t watch the Oscars. #united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work. Didn\\'t know that buying a seat in first class was just a \\'request\\' to sit in first class! Very Interesting. I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay. I need help with a missing bag. I was. But I have given up. can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I\\'m the only poor person in Aspen, that\\'s why I\\'m asking for standby on twitter. you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help! UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp... is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers might possibly have the worst service on the planet. deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I\\'m hoping its on there and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse I honestly couldn\\'t tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind. thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence thank you for following up! Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you. is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems? why doesn\\'t my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow? If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again? flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin can you help me get from IAH to SFO earlier tonight? was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse! UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy! I don\\'t know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I\\'m unable to do bc the site won\\'t let me.Seems to be ongoing How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed! I did. they told us the wrong carousel number. no thanks CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I\\'ve been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston why do you hate your passengers? how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn\\'t anyone actually do maintenance .@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good. is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!! Fingers crossed!!! #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw. -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool! they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me. Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever. #UnitedAirlines Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!! false. sitting on the runway in Newark, they won\\'t let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. hates us all. thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed. .@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim Good evening, UA. Can you assist with an issue via DM? Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at Great job idiots. 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines can Cancelled Flight my flight anytime if this is where they keep me for the night.. you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn\\'t even have curtesy to let me know, #UnitedAirlines Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays. seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever thanks for updating me about the 1+ hour delay the exact second I got to ATL. 🙅🙅🙅 but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed). what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me? been good 15yr \"friendly skies\" relationship. 2day agent told me I\\'m \"only Canadian\" and thus not good enough for military preboard yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots “@united: What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience* “@united: What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” free tickets , for the i convince . “@united: What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn\\'t been great. .@united I think not. I\\'m not flying you again, if I can help it. Resolved. Over hour of work on ground somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. I appreciate the quick response/service. always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle. EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071 .@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it? you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen. you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure tweet bots obviously don\\'t get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people. you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all customer service what\\'s That??? -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for \\'more quick fixes\\' breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline FAA invest near miss on O\\'Hare runway last Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!! that\\'s what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!! I am UA elite Gold and have a UA Chase pres. plus credit card. How many EQM\\'s do I need to get Platinum Elite! Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding now this Would be nice if partner tickets that don\\'t provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles nope. Even better there were 4 seats. And due to W&amp;B first to raise hands got to move up. I wasn\\'t fast enough. now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off look at this beauty 😉 dc-10 united airlines 😉 Hope you like this beauty 😉 seriously what\\'s with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn\\'t go up! . 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids! Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead! when I click that link it wants my flight info. I haven\\'t booked a flight yet. I read you waive fees for military, it this true? no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at or the every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card. so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage 8 hours Late Flightr and I\\'m siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service! I\\'ll let you know week after next when I do another coast-coast again. We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ?? has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status. it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade. I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag! yes I have they\\'re unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with #disappointed of course. But interesting how United doesn\\'t seem to have a good sense on what\\'s happening with flight pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately. finally made it to rep, who solved my problem. you guys are complete ass thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight! why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT. Thank y\\'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock! you friend\\'s flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow. Can you help with rebook? - Plane came in with broken seat. Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids. worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up! have you read your own same day travel change policy? your b737-800w literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k AND WE GOT ZERO VOUCHERS FOR HOTEL OR CAB. I expect some SERIOUS mileage credits. nope all set. Thx for checking. +the plane. my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a \"snow storm in Denver\". And now I\\'m in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+ still sucks. I don\\'t understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous \"I dunno what time you will leave today. \". Dunno?! That\\'s code for ...? on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos. has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter I\\'d rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it\\'s departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!! I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains! you could give me free flights for life, and I\\'d still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor. The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why? 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending is by far THE WORST airline I\\'ve ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I\\'ve flown to!!! It\\'s outrageous! ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now? thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks I hope you lose the next govt contract lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you! the bag is in a state that I didn\\'t travel to and the airports don\\'t fly to each other. Looks like it\\'ll never show ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not! stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor seriously? UA 806. Delayed because of the copilot isn\\'t here? For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing seriously. This is just complete bs. we\\'ve been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives? the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad! Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake ouch not fair is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don\\'t know how to value the customer I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it\\'s unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling if I miss the #Oscars I\\'ll never fly united again is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy flight delayed...again...every time. \"Maintenance issues\" I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn\\'t miss it. A+ work. yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned I\\'ll be calling tomorrow and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can\\'t get their tiny TVs to work! heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn\\'t get an email. maybe don\\'t play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn\\'t working...✈️ on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information. you still have flat tire policy. Shuttle broke down on way to ORD. Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!! thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone. so unhelpful... I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents said their too busy. Not cool flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation - In case you\\'re reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules. is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there\\'s no overhead space. Okay, just requested to follow. Thx, just DM\\'d. Conf #\\'s MQXC64 MPWNC2. Any help appreciated make sure you take care of team team. We are 16-0!!!! Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour crew is at their hrs limit we deplane. Unacceptable. stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K.... Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I\\'m glad it\\'s free for now. pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It\\'s been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame.. agent, \"You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full.\" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks. united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation no more flights to Norfolk that aren\\'t booked. Renting a car. I\\'ll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means. any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update. 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out? I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge. there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight? You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO. Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time. thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I\\'m in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren\\'t booked. Renting a car. thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight. Airlines are the absolute worst so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok. What do I do now????? ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to \\'passenger comfort\\'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would ! my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he\\'s booked me a flight you left my bag in Houston last night. It\\'s freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow. this is why I fly ... Never have any issues has terrible customer service doesn\\'t feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing. great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever! trying to check in for tomorrow\\'s flight. website keeps timing out. what\\'s up? yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help. Says can\\'t rebook says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The \"weather\" didn\\'t affect any other airline. #UA6136 Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.

I don\\'t know what DM the confirmation number means. Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex? What does DM the confirmation mean??? - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!! I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on. Now I\\'m going to LAX instead of Hawaii. reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn\\'t reseated. This only happens on international itineraries line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don\\'t have time. There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations. American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service. unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a \\'missing screw\\' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good. Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn\\'t want, all while not even notifying me. Great 1K service 👎 you guys are gay the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm it is now 1:40pm the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!! Thanks so much , my passport was recovered Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T no thank you - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time?? it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this? You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really? rescheduled my return flight from #Japan? Uh why? Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait. #fun is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡 no. Re-booked with American and United said they\\'d transfer our bags to them. I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better. I\\'m DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern? more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help! no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry ? I hope your standards are universally adopted #BadCustomerService Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that\\'s 7 hours you had. #fail! so many delays today...What\\'s up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks. called back and I\\'ve been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I\\'ve paid I\\'m not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps? check in and it\\'s still saying I haven\\'t paid. I\\'ve called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to welcome to our world, that\\'s a snow world today. Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn\\'t paid for it. So I called was on delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don\\'t care about our shoes. Ua649 It\\'s all about profit, and they don\\'t really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed I unfortunately didn\\'t get her name she was not nice! what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously? thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight. My bag is lost and I can\\'t get ahold of anyone that can help Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times! When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I\\'m told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a \"no show\" your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!! never flying United again! Worst experience ever ah, so that\\'s where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went. tried that. Cannot figure out where to go to get it. cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage. Please hep Did you get your 757 Model? flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable. we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service direct messages not going through please help why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures Adding reservation to iOS app doesn\\'t show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can\\'t be redeemed for upgrades thru your app I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What\\'s worse is plane is here but crew can\\'t fly!! Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium. Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight! doesn\\'t purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ? hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai so what\\'s the solution? is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted? no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in. so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter we got it, thanks. The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do.. This is probably the least dependable airline in the Western Hemisphere. does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam severely under staffed at Iah. amazing hospitality and helpfulness from Anthony Lastella. Great staff 👏👏👏✈️ def flying #united again. this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill just touched down in Miami - not too far off , Nicely done united 👍 what\\'s the status of flight 1008 Bogotá-Houston? really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag? broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues it was very comfortable, now waiting for our luggage getting ready to book a flight to San Juan. Was wondering, Does United waive baggage fees for military personnel. Thanks. once again you guys didn\\'t let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming thank you finally got through and they were very helpful. Appreciate it! pls follow for DM ah, that would explain why crew didn\\'t seem particularly distressed when we pointed it out. It was a little startling at first. not for me. I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax. can you assign seats “@united: It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer not my luggage it\\'s boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe just added one. Ty thanks for the effort. I can get the earliest. Though I will make a complaint for a refund as I am losing one business day tomorrow Pls hold UA2066 for 9 cnx pax frm UA6194. All runners. A 5 min hold will save 2 fam frm miscnx. Pls. Twitter is watching. no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR 🆖 THANK YOU! who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don\\'t even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening? oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system. feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL pls follow for DM. leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened? employee=faceless. Don\\'t throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I\\'m almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2 you can\\'t say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn\\'t even started! I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting DM\\'d you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag. worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!! two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain It was 3387. But we helped you with the weight issue, took your vouchers, and hopped on a flight instead. #winwin as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn\\'t enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST! this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance. you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!! can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated! can you get me to okc from Sacramento today. Dfw is now closed any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of \"pilots haven\\'t arrived yet\" announcements. Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence. you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights how are conditions in BOS today? I\\'m in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check. same day flights It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately. involuntarily bumped your passenger and can\\'t guarantee them another flight for three days! Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you\\'ve I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN! .@united Our newest delay, right now If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that \"really there are 3 not 4 seats\" 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out. Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad is a joke. Lots of angry people at IAH this AM. I6EP18 completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy) Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing? DM\\'ed you Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back. why de-ice before taxing? Maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks Flight 1547 CMH to ORD just arrived at gate. Next segment to YVR already boarding. Will they hold it? right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn\\'t this done when the planes were sitting out all night? two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight Delayed more and more these days. MCO IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don\\'t ask for extra peanuts... That\\'s NOT allowed! I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed. thanks for leaving our 3 year old in his own row flight 360 LAX-IAD I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your \\'trained\\' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don\\'t you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn\\'t get changed mid-travel you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue! with about 25 people trying to get on flights more lies... they wouldn\\'t let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line.. after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired thank you I don\\'t believe that you do.. can you change DKYDE6 to 4583&gt;36 on 2/23 instead of 3636&gt;606&gt;36; original reservation was for 4404&gt;36 yesterday but was Cancelled Flightled. flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever! they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn\\'t the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim. why don\\'t you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay fuck you for not caring 😢 its been five days, I\\'m just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don\\'t want to have to take this higher up. question. Are departure times based off eastern central time or the time zone your actually in? Very quick! TY. I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST! Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home! of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable! lost my luggage from ATL to hdn luggage in denver and said will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785 If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears! Was on NH10 on United ticket, rerouted to IAD due to weather in JFK. Can you get us home on United 5713 or 3277? Thank you for wasting my time money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but... DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you! why can\\'t you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue? why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can\\'t contact! Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can\\'t speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag! I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines! I would never fly United Airlines again! I am still in the airport waiting for my flight. your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days! now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow just did! Thank you! thank you! Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying \"think about your next flight...\" #customer #outrage did your super computer 💩 ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers - you rebooked me to UA1764 after UA 3883 was Cancelled Flightled. I paid for first class ticket - but new seat is 38E. Can you please fix! we need a new flight to Tucson is your check-in system down? I\\'m having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs. fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better. Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to? you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day I am - thank you! flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta. no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay.

The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here I just sent to you. your service need work - check out this Bush airport \"customer service line\" last nt #unitedagainstunited you realize you\\'ve said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed \"help\" Thanks. This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.

Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note. thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew hey, it\\'s 4am, guess what I\\'m doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports no my concerns were not addressed DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks oh, I\\'ll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA. *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff? Thanks for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask? you hung up on me again. your \"customer service\" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can\\'t even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?! it\\'s disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I\\'ve received tonight. of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That\\'s the ONLY reason I\\'ve been on hold for the past 5 hours! Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration. you\\'ve got to be kidding me. I still haven\\'t talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow???? .@united I wouldn\\'t describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost return it. and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best is that all that matters, not the fact that we\\'re at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress, 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag gee thnx. UA922 awesome job absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn\\'t there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is unreal!! nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left. averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I\\'ve gotten no help from you tonight. thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I\\'ve had to call back 4x. That\\'s 240minute wait times. you\\'re customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I\\'ve been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x. you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA what\\'s with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled? an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn\\'t let him fly is negligence. I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why? new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550 - you sure missed the mark on tonight\\'s redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better! after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets where is our luggage we just left (delayed). all set. Figured it out at the baggage office! screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN! why don\\'t you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline... Life goal: complete ✔️ I have $20 and I\\'ll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? 🌴🌴 It\\'s so cold here. flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me. That\\'s called throwing \"loyalty\" out the window and trying to give less awards. your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I\\'m in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives?? I\\'d hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk? that\\'s not an apology. Say it. Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment. download jeokoo the American app for air travelers been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest? no apology? Cool. you ask a lot of customers who you routinely screw over. You know that, right? I\\'m a first time solo female traveller and it\\'s pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are... I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers.... somehow I knew that you\\'d wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain. Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100\\'s of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I\\'m trying to figure out how to get home. Cool. we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time. poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how \"wifi is coming!\" Hah.Not before I leave. ftw Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas. more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn\\'t fly 6232 to JAC. thank you! Much appreciation for your help. Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!? worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354 Disappointed - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting for over 1 hr look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ and then to SFO is not acceptable. Phone Freakin\" Pick Suck 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please I\\'m still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back. screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us when they changed our flight, only changed the original #. 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985 YOU SUCK! yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age... if I was rebooked do I have to pick up my luggage? how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two just DM\\'d had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd.

Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though! do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of tomorrow morning given the storm? also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk I have a question Can you increase the legroom? How airlines compare via on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare? I see two flights with two seats in the morning can we get on those 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It\\'s been one mess up after another. Bad day the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food. sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards we will be at the airport first thing in the morning I\\'m rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat well this one missed the mark. She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter Doesn\\'t have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don\\'t have enough flight attendants?? we\\'ve been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We\\'ve only been offered water cookies in business class. #failed please get me off this plane #UA57 yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow morning. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go. traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason. have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable. our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!? your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD. #failed not completely. Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification. are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight Wife and I have two new destinations and I\\'m stuck in DC until Monday with no bags no I don\\'t. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority?

I\\'m trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn\\'t a hard stream. Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight why don\\'t you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don\\'t speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home? flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed. boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying it\\'s 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would \"sit awhile\" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm. had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I\\'ll never have to fly ever again .. I\\'d really like to get off of this plane now. possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding. Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive. She commented she didn\\'t care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs My contact stuff is in the bag and I\\'m legally blind. This is so messed up. Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I\\'m not going to have for how many days. 3 times I\\'ve called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can\\'t you call me back! Tell me that you\\'re at least going to cover a room and get me out of here. OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse. Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever. Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to \"Try again Late Flightr\". please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks U blow what exactly do you hang on this hook? - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?! why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick .@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you\\'ve got your work cut out for you. It\\'s bc you treat customers like garbage. what\\'s the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk? Pay for my hotel.... I\\'m a broke student #help all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help what a nightmare!! Both sides of my flights are a disaster! At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter you\\'re terrible. it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won\\'t be for days! Anyone there? Did you read my DM? 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!! EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I\\'ve EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim. it\\'s been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? trying to get a customer service agent. Just landed in SFO. Can\\'t fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!! why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20.

The $3 beer charge, however, is not lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded? finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue #customerservice at could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful. any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida? We miss our flights to FLL. instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays. Additionally, my husband paid for tv service it stopped working about halfway through the flight. following unfortunately, they didn\\'t. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled your baggage person told me to go through - they\\'re handling my connecting flight.

It\\'s no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline. yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent. Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious. I see. Thanks for explaining. Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call. After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me. Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!

You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L So appreciated! Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly. No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you! any help is appreciated. That\\'s a LOOONG wait for help on something that\\'s not his fault my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours.

This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE! not sure why u call it customer care.

Be a competent company like ur rivals No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, \"not with my hands!\" #badservice I need #United to be a better airline!! flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can\\'t help me I haven\\'t booked yet, I\\'m asking before I book Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I\\'ll make it.

Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won\\'t even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really. Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I\\'ve selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade! no announcement re extra baggage, \"find an empty bin\" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly Here\\'s hoping wakes up Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don\\'t honor it?? .@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names. once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff! Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage I was just calling the Global Services help desk so via phone. on final. Pls don\\'t let my connection leave!!! Conf# NPBHD0 fuck you, and your shitty fucking information you\\'re good. Thank you! how much does a ski bag cost to check? Bag contains 1 pair is skis and one pair of poles Wasn\\'t frustrating! Well, not in any way reLate Flightd to y\\'all, anyway. Impressed that I made it. no thanks I got it now. Wouldn\\'t let me log on with my email. Thx. Here\\'s hoping for dtw-ase without issue today oh, the Wi-Fi router is on top of the fuselage! ;) on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins I\\'m strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines your website won\\'t allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties** lounge #Heathrow Used by really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs then the \"inflight wifi\" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices? outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation\\'s not happening? Website wasn\\'t working. bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything. Long lines!! #ua1523 what\\'s going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days. what incentive do I have to give you another chance? my dad booked through orbitz and due to weather he can\\'t make it to the airport. Can you help him? Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15. #787 to begin Newark-London Heathrow route on May 6 Rebooked,arrived 8 hours Late Flightr. Last year 9 hrs to San Diego and the no inflight entertainment! lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can\\'t even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time. Thanks you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A\\'dam. Let\\'s see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states. Very impressed so far. An app that\\'s worth a damn and sms updates on my flight. any last minute flight deals for your cute little #frequentflyer ??? my Friday flight was Cancelled Flightled!! just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines airlines 1st only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. I should\\'ve listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks. officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane! 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn\\'t left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left. I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response. terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines Hi have a question re future Flight Booking Problems. DUB-JAC 29/9 JAC-LAX 8/10 LAX-DUB 13/10. I\\'m *G. What is checked bag allowance for JAC-LAX? My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I\\'m needing some help reFlight Booking Problems. I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number 757 N33103 taxies departing as UA26 to Newark Liberty Airport I\\'m afraid not... I fly or service every week and I\\'m just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy thank you. It\\'s my daughters 13th bd party w/proj. weather cond, it doesn\\'t look promising. Please assist with earlier flts to Cmh? if you\\'re going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don\\'t stall the inevitable. your plane\\'s been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck. Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better. 15.99 for wireless? Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst! have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA NYT say ? your \"Airserv\" contractors aren\\'t worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity. Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement web app won\\'t let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it\\'s a pita 132 characters does not cover my reasons I\\'m afraid while busy on his cell phone ??? really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address. \"Left gate 5 minutes early.\" My thoughts: \"That doesn\\'t count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour.\" #comeonpeople will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone? on flight 1665 but it\\'s not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean? do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag, didn\\'t have to check First Officer of UA 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from EWR yesterday while on his cell. Safety ??? i booked lh via ua. However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight. Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me. How do i get it coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3) I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh. good job at CLE .. TPA on schedule ... 4 to 5 inches of snow ! never fails to have delayed flights 😡 Yes, myself and about 200 other people also. is #ELP Friendly. #flyerfriendly #united #emb145 #elpaso it\\'s been booked into first class with curbside delivery 24 hours from now. I\\'m counting on it! #TeamUSA lets do that can you email boarding pass? “@united: We hope you don\\'t miss your connection. For help with re-Flight Booking Problems please Follow us DM your confirmation. ^CP”done thx is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks provide a voucher for one of my customers and I will tweet about you all day long #earnedmybusiness at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees stellar customer service. You have earned my business by your attention to detail. service by staff was great as usual. Cleanliness and smells a bit much. I\\'ll be back. #satisfied traveler now arrives LAX 8:03 am I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi. Hey you\\'ve upgraded me on a 10 hour International flight. I forgive you thank you! my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks. UA 1706 there is no way a plane \"loses its software\" I believe you decided to do an upgrade... already missed connection... UA 495 typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight... UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say \"oh well\" we are trying to go as far away from King\\'sCollegeLondon as possible for #charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service. yes to more food! Add some gluten free options while you\\'re at it no. U guys suck. I\\'ll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too. on a flight to New York! Love the quality planes on United!! #WTF #crappy #aviation #NewYork page United values your tweet b/c it\\'s so rare that they receive tweets complimenting their service...most are fake. yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer. thank you for a great flight in gfc Cheers bad customer service to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on United\\'s CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed? she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can\\'t respond b/c she\\'s alone I was flying home for a 9:30am event tomorrow. You pushed back my flight. Now I have a $400 ticket that won\\'t get me home in time. They held the plane! Made it!! - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!! ok, have sent u info via DM. I appreciate your help and consideration. 😊 flight 1136 from Chicago to Houston over 2 hours and no pretzels or peanuts?! Seriously about passed out. nice and early back home! I hope so too - after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here\\'s hoping they arrive I\\'ll make sure he\\'s done that. Thanks for the help. This is a huge race for him and just trying to make sure it goes smoothly. Peace I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I\\'m worn out! #EnoughIsEnough so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service. If you\\'d love to see more girls be inspired about becoming pilots, our free WOAW event March 2-8 at ABQ. your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service? .@united I took a screenshot and emailed it to myself. Let\\'s DM and figure this out. She 👏 won\\'t 👏 be 👏 at 👏 my 👏 wedding 👏. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There\\'s no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this? Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He\\'s competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help will you fill it? Yes they will. Thanks! #BringYourOwn, On last flight of the day no less.

His race is Sunday. Please help. Yes there were PLENTY of seats available. So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer? funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with \"issues\"... that would have been nice earlier today. Too Late Flight now. I hope. waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on? no still trying to get home. Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats That is not what your reservations desk just told me. They said there were plenty of seats very exasperating I\\'m having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you\\'re undergoing maintenance. Really, now? .@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching! Please call me at 310-795-2210. lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow no I did not make connection. Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return. no u don\\'t how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission! I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires? sure, but 8 different texts changing time gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off. you know what would be awesome? Providing us with complimentary entertainment on your flights. Especially those longer than 6 hours. DM sent. Thanks. to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service San Diego to Chicago. Leaving at 6:15 am tomorrow Stuck in this airport 12 hours in standbys cuz the pilot showed up Late Flight in PJs i missed my connectin flight.

Took care of it when I called THAT\\'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you\\'re not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain y not? You\\'re the reason we\\'re in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry. awesome thank you very much for the help you need to follow me so I can dm you to give you the info Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary yea I saw that I\\'m moving to China and have 5-6 bags will pay whatever but wanted to make sure it was ok to bring that many you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight! not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I\\'d be mortified if my employees acted as yours kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. Nice job 👍. has time to respond to everyone else\\'s complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer thanks to Lea in the Chicago office for her help in switching our Cancelled Flighted flights!! \"most likely\" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks. tell me something I don\\'t know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that\\'s crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally “@united: We don\\'t like to hear this.

UA7985 is a coshared flight w/ ANA. Unable to check in 24 hrs prior. never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best. when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at? Sure. Follow for a sec and I will. Thank you so much for your help with my birthday trip! Tickets are confirmed! airlines. On flight UA 1669. Need to make UA 3781. Can u hold the plane for us? thank you. when will I hear?

Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD. how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US. what time should I arrive at the airport for my 6:15 am domestic flight out of San Diego? #767 taxing in at #ORD #avgeek I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded I am going to a service desk now to see what the options are. I miss the Continental days. or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares. It wasn\\'t full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?! Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?! Thanks for nothing. Next time I\\'ll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right? first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunburn away...here comes the cold! Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !! how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven\\'t pulled up to the gate have little to no information. I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you\\'re good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening have better customer service at John Wayne airport. Bag was finally delivered and intact. Thanks for your assistance. passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn\\'t at the bar. Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What\\'s up with that??? is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I\\'m stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in. you\\'re right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok. - we\\'re sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can\\'t find captain. #ridiculous #united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced... You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!! Stuck in Houston because you can\\'t seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions. you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines. how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight? I left my dildo on the plane is there any way for me to get it back? Don\\'t know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific. Friendly, helpful. Terrific representative. Kudos. I\\'m Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don\\'t care about your customers. thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home! Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you \"can\\'t do anything\" #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility. You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw you guys suck! never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot. second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting.. Both flights went great and improved my view of your airline, cheers! Flight attendents on UA1022 deserve a raise again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I\\'m furious right now. I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great. landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airborne. Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn\\'t fix it. Flight was listed on website, but \"unavailable\"to book. False advertising much? I may not hit any new status this year, but I’ve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y’all every time! unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes \"like every 15 minutes.\" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we\\'re taking a cab. You going to reimburse? If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it? Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none. not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience. How can I file a claim when your agents won\\'t let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON\\'T find my bag it\\'s done. If you do something to make up for it I\\'ll tweet that too. I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean? I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don\\'t fly united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from to Amazing! yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this. give her the recognition she deserves! she\\'s the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year she\\'s one of the top flight attendants I\\'ve had! made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change. been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end? you suck. you\\'re the best. can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157 on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks Your \"Loyalty Team\" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google \"loyalty\" and get back to me? ^LOL Hey this is your job, don\\'t give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks Thank You if you mean beyond opaque \"maintenance issues\", yes, that would be basic in customer service which your EWR staff can\\'t manage. \"Dear Ted. We don\\'t care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United\" Terminal 1 gate B3. Flt 1299. Then take her to Terminal 5. Gate M13. Swiss Air LX009 . sad that you don\\'t think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1) - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA! He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day! That was the problem. We were being told the aircraft was on its way. will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel! I can\\'t even make this stuff up. do you know how to use twitter bro? Your terminal looks like it\\'s in Bosnia. Here\\'s another pic. you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible. I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors. now I\\'ll probably miss my next connection! any chance you\\'ll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like you may think I\\'m joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight. not the case. Now delayed due to \"mechanical issues with no update on departure time\". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues? Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!! I didn\\'t get a message from you. I\\'ll resend numbers. Yes, filled out the form last year. Don\\'t have case number handy. Guess I\\'m not cut out for the historical society afterall What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote resting elbows don\\'t mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels blasting volume. You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won\\'t be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA. Listen, learn do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA thank you for the reply. I will fill out the form and submit it as requested. Good to know you\\'re paying attention! Gate Agent Alavera is amazing I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business! wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! 👍 Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don\\'t have my bag!!! Why haven\\'t you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!! cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you\\'d like me to continue flying your airline. roundtrip to London on ? I think I will! FYI that\\'s another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies already Flight Booking Problems next week\\'s trip on thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail flight experiences R often frustrating, but 2day on UA5184 from CHI to WPG flight attendant April was #amazing! She\\'s 1 of the best! Also, group 5 is total BS. Don\\'t ask me to be patient without offering something in return. just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100 I will! On or all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable free booze for the Bach party would make it better! ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again We will enjoy either way. Thanks! (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too). I think they might really need this. Any ideas? - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago. Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2) incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd. - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can\\'t change. 5.5 hours Late Flightr I\\'ve been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO all good man it isn\\'t your fault that plane is having maintenance issues this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn\\'t cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi! Yes but unbelievable. Should have a free fare lock “@united: Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY” 👏👏 worst AIRLINE BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/ it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore. Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight. please tell me I\\'m going to make my connecting flight from O\\'hare to #STL #SouthBendINWhere 🙏 Lindsay and ??. Darn. Terrible memory on my part. I know they are headed back to IAD and then PIT tonight. I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs OK, thanks for the clarification. When are you coming back to You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you! also doesn\\'t help me. I\\'m a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing. delayed another hour as a million mile flier I\\'m embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched? Can\\'t beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight. NWS issued storm warning already... do it again! I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail don\\'t need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable. add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back. so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays. I beg of you plz sort this out soon! thanks! i will catch my conection! super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997! as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people! #letsgo 4016 529557. You going to transfer my car to me too? Because it\\'s at the airport you couldn\\'t get me too... next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can\\'t deliver it in a timely manner. I\\'m sorry it\\'s cold in chicago, but I don\\'t see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel. how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint? you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool. you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight or frontier ... Thank you. Any help is appreciated. FYI, went through this on similar flight last week. I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it\\'s changed to refreshments. Where\\'s my refund? Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we\\'ll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res? or us air: we can\\'t all be american airlines I suppose... Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let\\'s make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks uhuh.Group trying to get out of Nashville and into IAD today instead of tomorrow,why be preemptive though... thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom\\'s flight. You helped make his birthday start with #FriendlyFriday Awesomeness! 4 paws up! you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost! You NEVER get it right. blood services, make your appt. today! 18009174929 .@united It\\'s worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. \"But there are rules\" says Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm warning tomorrow already, what\\'s up? yes! I\\'ll be sending an email to customer service today. I\\'m fully aware, it\\'s just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you\\'re going to resell my seat for more $. why I won\\'t check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always. this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated. “@united: We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP” THANK YOU! United Cares! Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution. this is for a check-in luggage. Employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions. dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all. its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn\\'t cleaned properly. I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you. need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn\\'t cleaned properly just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff landing I can\\'t even look at you right now. I\\'ll call you when I\\'m not so mad. DM ed u the request num I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach Nope, still sitting at the gate! bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-in,correct? exactly the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations thank you.. Appreciate the response Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro .@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven\\'t taken off for a 10:30 am flight mine is GJQX6J husband is A587CW (Can\\'t DM for some reason.) thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm? If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane. thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest! Get more agents at sfo 25! perfect! That works! Thank you! That\\'s still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day. Followback so I can DM plz MIA-EWR #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 😡😡😡 No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure. your customer service is crap. thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks! mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern. UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate. thanks Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable. No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn\\'t. kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness? Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE On the plane but thanks! Maybe don\\'t let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons. Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline. UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We\\'ve waited our turn... yes I\\'ve boarded this way many times have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that \"slight delay\" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation. Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can\\'t reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number. worst flight experience I\\'ve ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again. why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line? Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help. anything yet JJ? why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie hey! DM not working. UA 307! the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it\\'s like sir u r lying how can I help splitting up my flights quadruples the price contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used? after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn\\'t caused by weather since when did you get so good again! 4 transcontinental flights in 72h. What a pleasure/relief you were. what I don\\'t understand isn\\'t flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight... Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can\\'t use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous Are the current on board food menus available anywhere online? Airlines Is Changing Its MileagePlus Program: Winners And Losers actually we aren\\'t. Still parked here. Can I put sun in my carry on? “@united: Right now 0 would be a heat wave, so enjoy the warmth! Can you bring some home? ^JJ” Thanks! thanks for prompt response. Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55. Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights? appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation takes me back to login page, it just goes round round, it\\'s be going on for weeks, Thank you for your prompt assistance. 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you\\'ve lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx! I looked on the email chain and there is not one why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years. thanks for more timely updates. Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression? I\\'m familiar with the procedure. It wouldn\\'t be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn\\'t seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact cleaning a regional jet takes an hour? Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!! thanks. That means I have 30 minutes to make my international connection to HKG KP I am not traveling - we trying to cheer up Ms. Bila. You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF? Thank you for your offer! All sorted out workin on it. Waiting on him to reply. Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!! Denver to LAX and it\\'s wonderful!!! of course not. The inflight crew was great! well played, ^LO. The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever. your website is a complete joke when using safari! the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck. I\\'m in another country - please Cancelled Flight my reservation. I\\'ve booked through Swiss air airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege via found the flight on that\\'s the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒 Did somebody say flight upgrade? DM sent. how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. This day and age message through Twitter travels fast. trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye! this is very disappointing. This is about customer service. boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can\\'t wait to give up my gold status for AA. my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous. nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance? that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help obviously no one knows a darn thing around here. What are we to do if this does not get resolved? so going forward, I shouldn\\'t be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App? I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time. I\\'m not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I\\'m extra bloated. DM sent. This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous. delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays. a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me. uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change? I\\'m rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I\\'ll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler United Club team is A+ got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $? will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board after the \"broken lightbulb\" I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight. don\\'t understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary. thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It\\'s a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway! 129 thousand fans of are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon! can\\'t wait!!! 787!!! flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn\\'t get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied Without baggage for 5 days and can\\'t get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever! yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill Bummer. Might have to go with card instead. TY for response though. “@united: Please DM details, we\\'d like to help if you need assistance. ^KP” #Another #Airlines #Issues or I\\'m sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money aggravation! I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver we are on two more flights today, let\\'s hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! thnx! - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight? just emailed Jim Compton and Jeff Smisek so hopefully you pay attention now I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we\\'re going to miss FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that\\'s fixed but can\\'t board because flight crew didn\\'t stay in boarding area #fail not anymore. Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff. Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket. Do miles earned with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles? yes, but they still don\\'t know where it is. I\\'ve been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it. what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage? wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I\\'ll burn it for warmth. #united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better. Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United? I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board. crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that \"sandwich.\" Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed). Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket? now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: your customer service is terrible done please send help ASAP to on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines define \"appreciate\".

I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail good fly!! #United #businessFirst .@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm.

I\\'d rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit. Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend? I need a breakdown of what the \"international surcharge\" on my flights cover. Please help Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers couldn\\'t have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That\\'s all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail flight #1051 on 2/23.

If not tell us now and I will rent a car. I do not want to end up stranded. .@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it\\'s not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG. so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline I\\'m sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don\\'t cut it or you\\'ll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson.

Thanks! education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus. Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight. Missing a black box? My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated instead of making seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint happy customers I need assistance with pulling your agents\\' heads out of their asses gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an \"UNMET ARRIVAL\"!! Another glitch?? in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United. I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks to start 3xdaily #ERJ145 flights from #Chicago to #Evansville on 4JUN #avgeek flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac \"waiting for papers\"... Cannot miss my connection at IAH ! worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse. no chance in hell. I\\'d rather walk. Worst airline ever. is the worst major US airline. More proof: they\\'re boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather. Wtf? [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i\\'m all set. always makes our cross country flights rad. here\\'s baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld Too Late Flight, damage has been done.

We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate. Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!

Came out before flight to play \"ask the captain anything.\" Wonderful ambassador to the airline!! your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world. what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!! Why don\\'t you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I\\'m still wating for my tickets!! I\\'m getting really angry and disappointed! then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again. So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer. pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now. Thanks great news that u won\\'t refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses Thank you for a wonderful global first class flight on your 777 to FRA. Great service.

Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta Thank you United! “@united: That\\'s a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN” to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they? I\\'ll be impressed if I actually get a response! 😜 hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found? 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim #inefficient has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument. its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money accordingly? U dont respond at all \"the extra care airline\". #unitedairlines they don\\'t care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don\\'t have 1 Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. it\\'s a shame the great customer service wasn\\'t continued in SFO. Slightly absurd #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys. still awaiting a reply from ur customer services? 18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines alright thank you. Much appreciated. has happened on other airlines and they\\'ve given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems. thanks, I\\'m booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis. agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful Any chance you are allowing reFlight Booking Problems yet for travel out of Denver this weekend due to impending storm? we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? Your dissatisfaction is und Thanks Yup I\\'m all set. It happens. SLC ground staff were prompt, helpful and courteous. There were plenty of empty seats in coach \"@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f\" all good, didn\\'t die or anything. As they say \"you get what you pay for\"! thank you so much. How will you be able to contact me? maybe on my return trip 👍 your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou i got it at the gate, thanks for checking! U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service. Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some? Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United! I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of Really? 9+hours???? We don\\'t like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We\\'ll have you on your way ASAP After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can\\'t UAL be honest with its customers? round trip* well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven\\'t left the airport yet. thanks. Not tonight it would seem. a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn\\'t have problems would be wonderful agent did help me. My point: there\\'s a problem I don\\'t want it to mess up somebody else\\'s plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls? .@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I\\'m also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again please do! She went above and beyond what she had to do, she made us her number one priority! you guys are awesome! Thanks! thnx I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system. Anna Palm Springs gate 19 deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!

I\\'m not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though... I have a LH return business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim? Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal? €202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots? what is your plan to reduce delays? I\\'m searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why? rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement. I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off left What\\'s your phone number? Customer service question. - Kids left a kindle fire HD 6 onboard UA1037 (ORD-SFO) today. Row 9ABC-DEF (we had the whole row amongst the 5 of us). Help... understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm “@united: We hope to see you on board soon and thanks for the tweet. ^EY” 👏👏 just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ? nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I\\'ll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the \"soft landing\" policy of no more than 1 level? (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air. she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family it wasn\\'t a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn\\'t an issue either. thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven\\'t really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from Yes my flight was rebooked. I\\'m just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time. thanks, keep up the good work 4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service! any solutions? what do you have in mind? I\\'m over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup I did they did not. I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don\\'t have that ID- you should find it it is cool. Your customer told me they didn\\'t care either. It is expected is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD - dpted 8:30pm -checked week\\'s average for UA3645 -shameful! 7 day average 7:54pm I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class? There were 5 empty coach seats near me? I\\'m a Premier 1K? fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus can someone at the airport in Portland, OR buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days Late Flightr by other from Perth, AUSTRALIA? Thanks they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there. What happens on 9:11 a.m. of 9/11 2spooky 4me m8 such spook much scare I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞 sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much .@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now. that would be great - 1k us651621 stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer? recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again. it\\'s freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn\\'t the crew here#tiredcustomer I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress? I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport. How will you make this right? enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match. after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡 broke my suitcase refuses to give me a repair estimate. How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline? can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm Let\\'s go! Join me on my first trip back to NYC…as a tourist: thanks KP. What\\'s going on w/4840 tonight. Bad update online and phone. Can\\'t u give customers good info. Not waste their time?! just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again. is z and d code airfare refundable? no, didn\\'t notice I was 38A until start of boarding. Assumed I was 8E. By time boarding started, GAs had cleared standbys, full flt 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site! 4840 WTF! Why can\\'t you update your times in a timely manner? You\\'ve known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! Want to book a multi-city fare. Have miles for 1of 2 flights. An option to pay for 1st flight with miles +2nd with UMP Visa? Thanks! waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That\\'s the last flight out tonight. HELP ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619- remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar carryons ? WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? next time. I\\'m in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here. you know it\\'s bad when you\\'re praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome playing hide and seek with the gate. \"We can\\'t find it, it should only be a few more minutes.\" so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed. your flights are really cheap what\\'s the catch LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she\\'d reserve it for me 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can\\'t figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 stop picking on us #CLE booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land! I\\'d rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. Leaving soon. Thanks! another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!?? Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation. my partner and I booked individual reservations for same flight. I have Pr. Silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow? 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O\\'hare... Painful this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it\\'s still in Albany and they won\\'t have a plane. Someone is compensating me Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one? WHAT?! Y\\'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too! .@united just curious why you\\'d board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no? sent DM\\'s just changed again. This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate? - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays? be worse?oh you can\\'t! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning. flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this. Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account! should contact me and the others on my flight who can\\'t get their website to work. None of our info is valid! over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience. line up #IAH #avgeek silence is very telling thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn\\'t break my Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount?? Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM Stars and Bars #A320 #avgeek I\\'m confused. After your agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! Had wonderful, on time flights from OGG to MSN Lost RX eyeglasses (thick) in the Admiral Club in Chicago this morning. Found? 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection “@united: See information on our boarding process: ^KP”. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5. in Bogota with no wallet is no fun. Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet. one hour after departure time and still no update! I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe? how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever! got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT CORNY as a… now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue. I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you. make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more How is this considered \"on time\" if it\\'s arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont… And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with now. yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can\\'t seem to know why the plane hasn\\'t left Albany. #Fail still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail an update on flight 5979 would be great! wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated what is the problem with your flights to ny today flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins) Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines! What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours. Frustrating! not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it\\'s about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working I\\'ll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated. Your survey is too long. I fly a lot of segments and I\\'ll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute. can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved Fair enough. I don\\'t usually rant, but it\\'s good to know someone\\'s listening. are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ?? would be hard to be worse than last time but I\\'m sure you\\'ll give it a shot Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too? “@united: Happy to have had you on board. Please share details here: ^KP” Done! service staff to is less than friendly! happens every time in and out of Newark. Can you transfer my bags too? I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight. tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done. we were able to get on the moon flight! Just got to our hotel in Puerto Rico! Thank you! you had us REBOARD without the captain. So now we\\'ll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I\\'m Late Flight now? Great! Appreciate it😊 I was well taken care of, thanks.

Thanks so much for the strong customer service!! just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce ok thanks. I sent you a DM too. You can disregard that. So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel 🎉🎉🎉 your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP! More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10. Last flight 11:15p. The construction going on is very inconvenient. perfect! Thank you! care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining. A man at 10p at LAX club. More..... smiling? NOT!! worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!! will I make it with the delay? we\\'d prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline why do you bother surveying me! I\\'m on standby for my connecting flight. 1st on the list. NudgeNudge I\\'m told there are four slots open. Save it for me. Please. worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.

I will thank you! thanks for making sure they hear the message! can i go #GolfUnited I got an email from cust. care for an issue I had offering me a voucher. How do I claim that?

Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something. 1k use to be special. 80 people in group one.

You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here. Unhappy with United\\'s service? Read Ralph Nader\\'s open letter to UAL\\'s CEO. Leave a comment or RT. ok. Can I DM you the info? the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice this happens all the time. United pilots are always in the exit row. America treats there customers better than their employees. yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats. Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right? OMG THANK U😻😻😻 unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2) error message said couldn\\'t process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2) 4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight 50 min and still counting... ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate ..shows total miss management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was rude in stopping a carry-on bag... your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don\\'t work you cheap as);: will do. Thank you! Okay, thank you both. they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I\\'m sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free. done as requested. Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that\\'s he\\'s going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He\\'s a hoot! ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I\\'ve EVER experienced. Makes look amazing. #UnitedAirlines please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He\\'s amazing. Mission accomplished! I can\\'t tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg. Turkish Airlines rebooked us a United flight on our second leg from FRA -&gt; IAD.

What most business people expect from airline wifi we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!! it\\'s not there we tried. It\\'s already here in cancun just no one has delivered it what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your \"customer feedback\" its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable Want to make my day? Friend is Premier I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus? please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service? that\\'s of course in lax ok thanks! Where are you counters located? And how Late Flight are they open? oh no, I\\'m rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time.

Go ahead, check. We\\'ll wait. I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way... well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You\\'ve Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me. I\\'ve been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now DCA-EWR Flight #4372 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives???? was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!! any chance you could look into my problem from earlier? this is despicable I spoke to many diff people everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight. Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL! I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don\\'t go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo! can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem. you can\\'t claim \"weather\" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won\\'t you\\'re missin the point! There was no \"weather\". You\\'re lying! Seats was broken. But u claim \"weather\" to get out of hotels. Classy are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year? I have flights that don\\'t appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help? I\\'m just an Aussie cowgirl lookin\\' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I\\'ll find him there! Okay, thank you for your help this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain thanks I bet doesn\\'t turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA\\'s fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. Group 2 is too big! final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number was in the air. Just DMd you Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together.

Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering. was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here. sprinted from C concourse to E and just made it. Coughed up a lung in the process but am now in CLT!

Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating Flight 280 Flight 1640 (N33289) arrives at following flight from is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage! I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks! yes, you can. I will DM. Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security? hi! I just bought a flight with united through ebokeers from Paris to Miami. Do I have any chance to check that everything is ok? no worries, I think it’s under control. (the emails are keeping me informed) i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn\\'t look good. May have to stay here till Friday that\\'s not guaranteed ^JT is the ORD to PHL flight at 9:15 PM (CDT) delayed? DM I\\'m kinda hoping not to be stranded at ORD either. what happened to flight status map? It was so cool.. plz don\\'t advertise wifi if it\\'s not gonna work thanks #worstflightever Hi guys. I submitted a request for ticket/hotel reimbursement for a delayed/over night stay coming back from the Dominican. Help? Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times. yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside? A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn\\'t add up. hello. I\\'m overseas my bag is lost. I can\\'t call customer service but can you help me? landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! I knew I should\\'ve flew lol UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice charged me. Who do I need to file claim with? thnx I will admit, you\\'ve been rather good to me over the years. You\\'ve still got me hooked. (for now!) Peace. it\\'s kinda funny. No worries. My feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences. just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked! great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then It was quite enjoyable. 😊 Except now he\\'s stuck on the runway in Houston. 😕 thank you for getting our daughter home when Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated. makes total sense, except flight wasn\\'t full I\\'ve got empty seats around me overheads were more than half open when I boarded. “@united: Sorry to hear about your flight. Do you need help reFlight Booking Problems?” 👎 now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O\\'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight. Alright, thank you. Is there a page that says the routes you have for each aircraft? Specifically the 787. well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on costs $165 #customerservicefail I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me. there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us? done thnx I\\'m still frustrated I gave up my seat the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection. PTY to PIT via IAH Not sure what happened MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery 2:30 am Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations? I\\'m flying on the way back. I rarely fly them but let\\'s see if they are any better.... sent it\\'s almost like we\\'re punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I\\'m sure it\\'s just cosmetic. thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int\\'l flights, it\\'s crazy #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag... have reported it. Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently. On the other plane haha. Hats off to the pilot! Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price??? hey awesome! Thanks for the reply, will be filling the form out! flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help correct date is 2/11/15! 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you? a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required can\\'t DM, you\\'re not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats. the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us 1 hour since boarding began and we\\'re still sitting at the gate. #UA507 Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight insufficient ground crew to handle took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to \"fix\" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can\\'t be determined better. patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline idea: if u don\\'t want us to be frustrated don\\'t Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn\\'t arrive until 6:07 please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine in-flight promo on their TV\\'s includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation. thanks I\\'ll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to. I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to.... Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying. I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay? How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate? “@united: We don\\'t want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one. 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please! nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad... #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better? well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough well it IS John Hughes\\' birthday. But I will stick w the plane hold off on trains automobiles. Gate workers are doing well. - my son left his tablet on plane. Am out of country and can not call easily. Is there an email to contact? I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a ticket instead. ill be driving there not flying yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed. thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr! thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today! Just did, thanks for checking! just informed you don\\'t reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you Midland couldn\\'t get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA check em in there. this may be the last time I fly your airline. Is your company motto: \"I do not care!!!\" I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.\" #idonotcare you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing. Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we\\'re off the plane. Give me my money back. UA3466 Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!! there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened \"do you want to get to SF today\" #fail flying lax to Sfo and system won\\'t let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through and they tell me through you. and btw, the and managed on time departures same time same destination- wouldn\\'t take away a 9year old kids bag! can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I\\'m in heaven now en route to LHR feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I\\'m not a grown man but tears happened sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back! UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay. How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!? I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse? it\\'s operated by united as it\\'s a heathrow-Newark flight yes of course I have. Is this how you treat customer with no recourse? I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me. The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards Can someone assist me with my DM\\'s? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter. Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer. thank you! Thanks - it\\'s very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates. As a Million Miler I\\'ve been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I\\'d be embarrassed to be affiliated. airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won\\'t honor a lower fare that I found. Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I\\'m mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad still can\\'t dm, it\\'s LH7631 on 21/2/15 Thank you Margo at Houston\\'s Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier. I booked our flights w/ I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn\\'t the least bit frustrating. #customerservice Thanks, but I didn\\'t want to see \\'we\\'ve started your flight search over\\' OR \\'the fare rules for this itinerary has changed\\' again my cats flight was delayed 1+hour she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 I won\\'t be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭 I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight. now you\\'ve lost my bags too. At least nobody has done anything to help out. This is absurd. What\\'s up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+. Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight! when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too? I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M). my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do? sweet, follow back and I\\'ll get the dm off my reservation were changed so that I can longer make my connecting flight. How can I change this without incurring a fee? all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍 flight 5431 Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn\\'t let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight! Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you. Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn\\'t work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo Nice \"partners\" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help. Just had the worst experience ever flying with you UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You\\'ve been doing this for 2 hrs. why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating! my plane sounds like a DJ scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee. chase says no referral bonus. Thanks. how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact? rebooked. This one is Late Flight too. 2nd Late Flight flight today if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $\\'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles? 3586 from IAD to BUF. Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus. #lowstandards Cancelled Flighting. bought a ticket for a friend but cant get the credit under my name Boeing 777 Star Alliance short finals 27L on an amazing winters morning #777 #Avgeek 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip). I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you your overall experience of flying is not friendly a good start would be to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn\\'t delayed due to frozen water lines. annnnddddd I\\'m going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone. 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me every time I check a bag with your airline I\\'m confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days. Please prove me wrong. trade show! Come by both 130 for awesome deals on #sunkist and $$ Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged please help! Left my iPad Air 2 on my flight from NYC to Paris yesterday and can’t get in touch with anyone locally. What to do? When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is. you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United \"coworkers\" I\\'m guessing our benefits aren\\'t great. I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I\\'m speechless at your system just because you are a monopoly in doesn\\'t mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap. Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual. I\\'m actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense. How much is baggage check for International flights? Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines? Ridiculous and inflexible \"policies\". I need a phone number and a resolution. Now. LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems (2/2) It suggests that if can\\'t confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn\\'t used to be that way Thanks for explanation.

Contact me pls \"federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag\"...yet you lose our bag and that\\'s okay tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees... Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks. do you guys have any working planes? we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!! again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it. 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won\\'t move. This biz traveler is never flying u again! my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding another plane and is stopped. That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2) Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2) The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone. Ugh. My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised. They better be at the hotel when I get there. Direct Messaged you, didn\\'t hear anything back yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months Great, thank you!! I\\'ll send it now. so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn\\'t you put me onto them in the first place? big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could\\'ve been used in the first place. Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou my golf bag didn\\'t have a top cover + staffers said they couldn\\'t check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag... when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow? once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something both! Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR... - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn\\'t an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven\\'t waited less than 20min in years did I mention one bag is an infant car seat we\\'ve been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I\\'m open to what will u do to make the \"flight more pleasant.\" hard to believe since your staff SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day. it\\'s Late Flight... I\\'m tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn\\'t chipper, but I def was not rude. rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag! Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport. Much thanks! Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that. Got me home amid snow Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone an upgrade. Thank you! My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result. so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public. #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u. 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund? so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it? so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…? This link in your tweet goes to someone\\'s internal email -&gt; Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again. 618 was flight out of Houston free hotel doesn\\'t make up for such poor customer service and disregard it\\'s messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting. mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I\\'m a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them. Cc #boldflavors “@united: We’re bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options\" thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail is there a referral program for the Milageplus explorer card? how else would I know it was denied? obviously You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who\\'s left holding the bag. #flyunited Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive I sent an email describing my experience.

Are you telling me there is seriously no other way? instead of Bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #SaveTheDiagonals 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land I\\'ve been doing this for 15 years and I\\'ve never had this many issues with any other airline. haha that\\'s fine. Still won\\'t fly ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else. note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service. mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf captain \"we apologize for the delay, the company is looking for an open gate (glance starboard side, see 5 open gates) reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?

You delay flights but can\\'t hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver I Want a Plane dad time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United it was an international flight, and we didn\\'t get our new eta until we were in the air. - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks! - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello ! Useless response.

Unbelievable hypocrisy!! thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this. now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse... thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was born in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson. The third wheelchair is broken! She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm! ooh thanks! my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service. Do they care, nope. Delayed until 7:55. very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it We were told by United to \"carry over/carry back\" for the refund. no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now I feel completely cheated I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there. 0162431184663. 3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket. if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff IT-problems with the link? #3thparty I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me can I get some help changing a ticket. 40 minutes on hold and counting.... thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup Your MileagePlus signup page is broken. $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I\\'m gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours... FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful. so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun once again your customer service rep was rude! I asked a question and in turn got attitude. Jane was no help. Disgusted again! can you not see the thread? poor old United: never seem to get the response right obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport also why can\\'t I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I\\'m a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare seats? thanks! Hypocrisy I\\'m sorry, we\\'re not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP I shouldn\\'t have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL eventually. You should approach bags like they get it. What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago? said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund. how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt. we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected. if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase. Same if you choose to vary it by airport! We want a FULL refund!! wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united. I\\'m 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn\\'t bad!👎👎 don\\'t check your baggage if you don\\'t have to. They will lose it! I\\'m hoping we don\\'t miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN! well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated. We travel between Canada USA on United with only Nexus how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?! You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around heading back to the gate. #connection? Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! Call customer service and of course they just say \"theres nothing we can do\" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line. Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for? Classic Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I\\'m super pleased! Thanks! Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a \"premium\" cabin? flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input? A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering. no thanks Yesterday, I\\'m sorted now. thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can\\'t believe you guys actually charge people to \"fly\" united If you have had any issues with United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead. just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn\\'t like the exchange rate? #doublestandards do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn\\'t receive, how do I know this won\\'t happen this time? 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300. stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone. calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke. They couldn\\'t get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself. but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids I\\'ll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter. United airlines should be ashamed. Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. JT thanks for your help I’ll complete the form once we are back home missed it. Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight... Ladies and gents - United Airlines... You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day thank you very much for an amazing airline Allright! Last question the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin? Well, It\\'s LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I\\'ll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:) yes still need assistance I don\\'t have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections ! I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive. Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty. My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times. If I am no show, you\\'ll know why! Ridiculous. you\\'re just using automated responses and don\\'t have the decency to actually care/respond JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It\\'s ok! Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members? for our birthdays my fiancé I want to travel Late Flight April. You\\'re our fave airline but Frontier has this: I’m resending the confirmation code in a DM I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone Airlines\\' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers via The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it\\'s a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem? thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her no claim number. Haven\\'t been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone? do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow? Got it. I am following the United page. Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your \"fine print,\" haha worst service ever 😈 thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option? can\\'t believe United can\\'t find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice I am furious. You\\'re firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United holy high speed internet batman! Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast! Thanks Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain. like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative! Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..😡... sorry, I hate united. i won\\'t get to see my family until Thursday Thanks for the timely service great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon. done just now, thanks. Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly. Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number. All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you? thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight. Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines. can you send me another confirmation email? it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders. I travel a lot and I get it. You\\'re still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on. 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed. Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines. sorry, wrong link for the bag Thats the one i meant flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat? Please. thank you! 😊 take a lesson from , they know how to treat customers! plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I\\'ve flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible you\\'d learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want customer service 👎 Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O\\'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air Hi again, any updates here? Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled. .@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now? Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm now we won\\'t leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened Supposedly, they\\'re out for delivery. I\\'ll believe it when I see it. Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay! Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I\\'d like assistance in getting compensated for my bag. took this picture on Thursday. #awesome probably wouldn\\'t be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993 I can\\'t even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years. Is expiring the offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded. Nothing got refunded as of yet So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I\\'m stranded away from home and work? you are really trying me today. looks like I\\'m settled in to where I\\'m going. Thx. flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes. no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition. was never given one quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can\\'t tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!! flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class. flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don\\'t you figure out a solution and announce once? bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee. who can tell me where they are? flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful. each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don\\'t even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats! flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she\\'d been txting on waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude I don\\'t see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure. I don\\'t need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error now there are no comp seats its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic! thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn\\'t miss my transfer... No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department? We have submitted our claim through email without success. I\\'m not this person, but I\\'ve been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home. flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up! I just need to get to RIC tonight. I\\'ve been in EWR for 24hrs now. which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline. It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren\\'t honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here? What is the policy behind changing passengers\\' seating assignments at the gate? with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude called United at the time told she could board but Karen would not accept she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus. 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!! u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no. yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!! doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We\\'ll still make destination on time Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown? stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week the refund request functionality on is broken.i get a time out error. Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate. giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay. $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service! just played the Most bizarre \"safety\" video I\\'ve ever seen... Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it. 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can\\'t? WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent experiences. Second day attempt trying to leave IAD I\\'m on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed! Is there a direct number to call to request a refund? Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket. No number on site when is my plane coming? Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane. Not fast enough. No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful. thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers! my mother\\'s flight was delayed from phl-ord. We\\'re on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum. Blegh is Late Flight again. Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew. Really! Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home spending the afternoon Mia. Not your fault. No lounge? Very inconvenient. costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response Is there a way to get a copy of Feb\\'s edition of Hemisphere magazine with out flying? I somehow think I\\'m going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime. I guess we\\'ll see. I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a \"kid\" section (near the back) ;) of course I need help. I\\'ve been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX. Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4 Is Changing Its #MileagePlus Program: Winners and Losers #airline #travel #loyalty #rewards Brandi Zabsonre in Denver deserves a raise for bringing delight into a terrible travel situation. big ups thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango! I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy? you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem Thx! Stand by! “@united: I know it\\'s frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH” roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them? dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven\\'t heard anything about it since, when do I get it back? that\\'s what I thought! Thanks for the clarification! feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!! + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they\\'ll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference! pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don\\'t notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant. i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me? + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year would hate to be in that situation. .@united we rebooked. But and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating. no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, \"Fly the Friendly Skies.\" I am thankful to the United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home! I appreciate the follow up. + that\\'s the gist of what the flight attendant told her. BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? + +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger\\'s shoulders. + No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business. sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate.. Sigh actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation. Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can\\'t accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY! first-class #cockup all day travel. #swag #ijustwanttosleep Thank you for the new Club at O\\'Hare. Very comfortable. You made the difficult weather days proficient and enjoyable. Filled in the form you sent the link to on 29.1.15 and then either 9 or 10.2.15 did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive! Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz United Terminal SFO Airport why am i mot getting my refund? .@united nothing apparently. I\\'ve flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks. didn\\'t get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard... You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD) THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last... what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won\\'t work #hopeless how much does it cost to check in an additional bag? Traveling from newark to glasgow. Thank you .@united call my work and tell them it\\'s your fault I\\'m Late Flight New Apple crâpe, amazing! Live from UA1207. Really nice crew too. #AmericanAir has biscuits, UA needs them 2 clicked on the link and got this? #confused is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on i have items of sentimental value that I\\'m heartbroken are missing even though technically after I land I will be silver? still waiting for a reply please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn\\'t there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!! Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can\\'t yet tell what any problems are except see snow. I like delays less than you because I\\'m the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher and don\\'t hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am. still waiting.

I enjoyed a call from my good friend he\\'s Flight Booking Problems his flights elsewhere as I tweet one at a time I will tell as many as I can thank you. Great customer service so far. Accidents happen I understand. Hopefully everything works out. my question is this: what\\'s up with the crazy boarding procedure?

Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone\\'s spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations it\\'s not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really? Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special show tonight! Thx again The problem is apologies don\\'t help. Results matter and it\\'s proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that. no fare giving out clues. In route now. telling my Fam in Vegas now. How many tickets are left? thank you! is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN do these scavenger hunt locations have anything in common because I\\'m playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL. Why do you have to be 18 😭 ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury. What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!! Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn\\'t showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile... 3 hours and 80 degree difference. Yes please!! MHT TO MCO sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action. still there? I was posted up in Downtown waiting for y\\'all. On my way! like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals.

Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today... that was supposed to say \"boo\" not book. booo. #Vegas I was there 5 days ago. Miss the Warm Weather Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises right? We\\'re delayed so I\\'m crabby.

Awesome staff at the check in desk! They had a paper airplane race for a SW gift card to keep ppl entertained during delays but when do I get my gin tonic !?!? is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm????? will continue to be my airline of choice. -most frustrating travel day I\\'ve experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?! just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that! Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle. But for real, you should fire I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty done. Sorry, I thought I was already. I can. Doesn\\'t it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them? Your Terry is our hero!

Any idea when I\\'ll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to \"listen to the intercom better\". nice touch on the passbook integration! easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards... a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it\\'s being abused every airport... it\\'s not disappointment, it\\'s a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it\\'s becoming a problem that\\'s pushing need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired. Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!

Just sent DM. when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won 😭🙏 The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad. the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn\\'t working properly my Nexus 5. sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn\\'t believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it? What\\'s up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. it\\'s too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!! Can you please follow so I can DM? Thx! sent DM I love you. Air travel doesn\\'t get easier.

It\\'s scheduled for 455 not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You\\'ve ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation. you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I\\'ve been delayed 3 times .. keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation. Report was filed but would like to support some active searching. Feels pretty passive now. Info on computer is precious. surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm. Broken down equipment. This is unbelievable... Thank you so much! #DestinationDragons AMAZING c/s today by SW thank you SO very much. This is the reason we fly you #southwest is the best airline out there no one is better than them #OneLove #Southwest #bestairline great cabin and flight crew this morning on #578. A great smile and happy staff are signs of a happy company. Thanks. thank you for always going above and beyond with your customer service!!!!!! #favoriteairline #luvforSW #southwestAir yes can do Why doesn\\'t mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account. great news for today. Finally, Columbus\\' top unserved market will have flights. no flights to HRL is this a limited route? is really stepping up their \"service\"🐩 this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I\\'d be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds... #Flight7 are there any flights from MSP to HRL in March? I\\'m looking at 3/19-3/23 Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular. I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn\\'t there be some sort of compensation? A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I\\'ve had. What\\'s up? Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn\\'t deserve that, I remain a LOYAL SW customer! I owe you an apology. My tweet was out of frustration, not constructive criticism. I\\'m a SW fan LOVE your service! wouldn\\'t it be awesome for my first time flying to be #DestinationDragons?! ..just booked trip to Cancun...❤️ no baggage fees..but need to have more flight time options thank you!!! #bringbacktheluvtordu #miami #directflights I can easily get to the Atlanta show, I just need tickets, help?! got \"duped\" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won\\'t give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful adding direct flights from #Columbus to #Oakland, via That would be great. Thank you!

Never flying SW again! #badservice I already follow you and can\\'t DM because u need to follow me back My DM won\\'t go through but it is 261633561838. Please let me know if you need anything else. Can someone rebook me? Please direct message me. rude customer svc, won\\'t accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw. having trouble reFlight Booking Problems a Cancelled Flighted flight. no one picking up phones and your site isn\\'t working.

Congratulations!!! friendliest employees I got a phishing email claiming to be from Southwest. I can forward to you if you\\'d like to investigate. unfortunately no, it\\'s my lack of status that\\'s the big problem. My company policy forces me to buy the cheapest tickets Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO Superb choice - SWA. I am a raving fan. They even take stress out of weather-reLate Flightd glitches! #custexp has 22 employees on Social Care Team, 4 staff the Listening Ctr. at any time-rest of spots filled by other areas. #RaganDisney listening center is open seating just like on their planes. #RaganDisney Double up with this comment.

Download speed was 0.21mbps I ended up watching the free TV instead. sure can! Just a second. oh my god thank you so much!!!

No one will appreciate this more than me!!! boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn\\'t our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭 when are you opening the flights beyond august 7th??? pleasantly surprised to be boarding my flight on time this morning at Good job! Ahhhh! Sorry, just followed. TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs! I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee LaGuardia who ruined mltple people\\'s travel plans yesterday Awesome!!! Sending now. I left something on a plane landing at Midway last night because I am a responsible adult -- got a number for me to call? TY! Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # put it in my acct. But it\\'s not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated? why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes? really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate???

Lastly, for a company that\\'s trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns. In my letters to follow, I will be sure to include my Rewards Number, twitter handle, and email address. Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero. By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time baggage time. Finally got me home #BNASnow Therefore, since I\\'ve received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint a letter via mail will follow. I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I\\'m astounded at the lack of concern about customer\\'s flying experiences. This experience was the worse flying experience I\\'ve ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse looking for cheap flight to vegas please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused. So today I call into Customer Service speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office I am told there is nothing he can do We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour\\'s wait. No apologies, no explanation.

Delayed three hours. CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American thank you. Appreciate that!! The chairs could use some TLC. And more power outlets in the area would be a bonus. Headed to ! Thanks. Used phone instead of computer and it worked!! Thx again! someone should screen what you play on your flights. For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look \"normal\" ???? alright done! alternatively, if you\\'d like to charter a private jet for me to PITT i will gladly accept great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we\\'re at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags. absolutely, my girlfriend and I will be Flight Booking Problems our Mexico flights in the next day or two, will send a Tweet when it\\'s done! it\\'s time for a direct flight from #JFK to #PITT.... Official JetBlue Terminal 5 - New York… Indeed. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on in Pittsburgh that weekend, but, it\\'s drawing a crowd via JetBlue! I believe it\\'s Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn\\'t available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today. All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse buggy. So what\\'s a little delay right. good to know, thanks so much! Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner HE is a lap infant (4 mons old) Thanks. Thank you for the quick response! I am trying to request abassinet for my son. it would be great if you can help me with my request Gerne Hey friends! Stupid question - Can I split payment methods for a flight purchase? Example: 1/2 debit card, 1/2 BillMeLate Flightr? Thanks! Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:\"your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins\" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer! All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy surprised. expanding! #Nantucket #Aviation Mark T. in Austin was great handling my bag issue. #thanks I believe you have to follow me so I can send you a message I\\'ll read this over a nice glass of wine right before I dig my heels into my next novel! Maybe travel is just what I need... Good one! And indeed, it\\'s JetBlue\\'s finest day in history! I would like the actual email address so I can follow up. thank you. ...and when did your legal department start running your social media channels? nope. The \"regular\" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS. sounds fun! How does that work? thanks! Calling right now! Thank you, but that isn\\'t really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site. I know there\\'s no actual \\'mile high\\' club, but surely there\\'s something I can join ;-) hello! my husband bought us a trip last night just noticed my last name is misspelled! What can I do? Thanks! to start 3xweekly #E190 flights from #Washington Reagan to #Nantucket between 19JUN-6SEP #avgeek I would like to communicate directly with a \"Customer Experience\" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address? will you Cancelled Flight tonight\\'s 7 pm out of DFW to BOS? #weather Haha. Thanks. You guys are great. Unlike the ;-) #GoPatriots! thanks it was booked through work but added upgrade on seat. Need the upgrade receipt. Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF Thank you for the free flyfi!! Makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #Boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter what\\'s the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? Can I get one at check in or can I get one online? Thanks! thank you!! any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset keeps getting better. No water on the plane. .@JetBlue That\\'s what I planned on but Boston traffic due to recent weather was insane! If I had been expedited I would have made it. I wish you all the best of luck I\\'m enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space rn. Thanks I don\\'t want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI great to see the RedSox plane and your reminder you ❤️NY side by side at JFK #catsanddogslivingtogether would love to go to Hawaii to visit pearl harbor. what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight? lol at your \"estimated departure time.\" Plane hasn\\'t even started boarding yet. You can\\'t even get your delays right. you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening. said they haven\\'t started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can\\'t find $100 outfit. 😒 How can I best track deals and special flight offers? I\\'m liking your international options... yeah I\\'m aware of that. Hence my original msg to you. 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster. no I asked. Either way it doesn\\'t make the flight less delayed. 2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert! Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven\\'t contacted me yet. shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta. as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting \"Webpage not available\" after submitting online form no one yet but some, fl 8162 are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We\\'re just sittin\\' here on the tarmac waiting. Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn\\'t be too hard to trap and move them. not an issue but I think training information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better Rats, that\\'s a bummer! is so sloooooow today Happy for SFO, but hopefully you\\'ll add PDX soon “@JetBlue We added two new destinations (FLL and SFO) from Las Vegas in the last year!” flight from JFK-SFO was pure awesomeness. Mint Class and Tim our attendant was the best! Other airlines, take notes! terrible landing on 915 flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS. wall separating in row 1. #safetyconcerns last sleep in Cali... back to JFK tomorrow night. Looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs! Power of positive thinking, people. appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was \"There is nothing we can do\" idk if that\\'s what you mean with the free wifi #impressive #FlyFi Didn\\'t find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail. Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this. #epicfail I understand delays. We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay. mint seats are AWESOME! best business class in the US!!! - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow. No snow on weather map!!! WTF!!! thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward 2 words: \"staff training.\" What a joke- is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don\\'t hold it. 5 minutes. sorry, should have specified I meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal any idea what\\'s going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a \"courtesy report\" ok thanks. Safety first. apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today? that\\'s ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man! No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. - Fix your jet bridges. 40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting! #jetblues Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my experience today measured up to their example! ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please? Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please! didn\\'t work. Fly-fi plus couldn\\'t access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed 👍. I think I\\'ll come take a nap at the terminal. ;) Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not. pretty sure he\\'s saying Ricoh had great service down at BOS ;) #happytohelp #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed? the lack of TV made it rough, that\\'s literally why I picked y\\'all over the competitors. But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous. THANK YOU! I am your new big fan I do! The best airline wifi ever. Thank you! you just tight that you\\'re #59 on the world\\'s best airlines list is ranked higher! here I come! i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi??? such a bummer. But I understand it\\'s a business deal. Thanks for answering me! Much less sad now. aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that\\'s just no pilot: \"Don\\'t worry folks there\\'s a backup for the backup for every part of this plane.\" Thanks guy Can you take off your blacklist... trying to work \"Goodwill\" now at $125.00. $27,000 x ? = Fine Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136 thank you! Hopefully it\\'s soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23 thank you! awesome okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific? hard when you\\'re with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome! even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people? I thought being a mosaic member had \\'perks\\' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I\\'m carrying it on 😒 are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous if only the show was on the flight. No ABC. Oh well. I\\'ll live. #nexttime #andthewinneris... ill call in the morning. too upset right now. im still waiting??? No answer!! Ok. Thanks for your help. Love you guys😍😍😍 the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn\\'t make up for the money lost. being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can\\'t be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk. Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback you\\'re still the best please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I\\'m missing the oscars right now, and it\\'s awful #whyabcwhy Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems? I\\'ll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed. I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed Thanks! I made it 😃 after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible! thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then \"Considering?\" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight #missingtheoscars Thank you. Fingers crossed. .@JetBlue ooookay that\\'s silly of you. guess we\\'re \"watching\" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars I\\'ve heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible certainly not EMV compliant you\\'re taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I\\'ll picture that while I shiver #forevercold We\\'re flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p. 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn\\'t allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What\\'s going on? I\\'m dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom? If you want, we can keep you updated on who\\'s wearing who, who\\'s with who, who wins what. We\\'re nice like that. ;) I did. They have no idea where it is. thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA?? hey JetBlue. Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9\\'8\" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports. your gif game is strong. well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc? Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK? #annoying your crew didn\\'t say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether I\\'m going to write a post on about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars. I bet his flight was on time. #JUSTWRONG okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn\\'t help bc going on break aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all Will do it at the airport tomorrow then! that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv being told by 3 ppl to wait they\\'d come back but did not. Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day. just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I\\'ll be able to go home! what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades? thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned. Tx for the info. Just don\\'t understand why you couldn\\'t accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now. hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys “@JetBlue: So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.” Me and JetBlue are #BFF 🙏 no m\\'good. Just get me home thanks for the response. We are hopeful. Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks all day how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right. why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem? Is that a guarantee? We\\'ll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat. thanks for the update. \\'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home... WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won\\'t be on this flight unless I pay more. If seats aren\\'t guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats. thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus yes, please get me the seats we paid for. Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM Finally!!! Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM. That\\'s a long flight. AKA BUS thanks for help. Can\\'t wait to travel with! And get out of the snow. Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do? I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper. the man with the smell left nd now there\\'s this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help. FYI, The last email response - \"we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you\" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future... nice touch. lol I think I have it selected already ☺️ last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal. thanks for answering my questions! that wasn\\'t delayed or cabcelled I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight.. I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!! I think it\\'s safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue I have someone driving me, it\\'s best to get a wheelchair once I get inside? finally! Finally! Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger anything serious I should worry about? cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs. Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you?? #jetbluefail Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there\\'s a problem with the plane? Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don\\'t tell me you were snowbound in PBI. the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight. sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated. This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there\\'s a problem? #jetblue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier? thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot flight 2008 Pittsburgh you\\'re lucky we\\'re still flying you after today\\'s landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids! so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied? if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don\\'t quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail do you REALLY think it\\'s okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your \"terms\" response is insulting. #jetblue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket! What\\'s your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air. if you can\\'t guarantee parents will sit with their children, don\\'t sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue once you go blue you don\\'t go back why are there so many delays to north east cities? kids fly. Don\\'t hire people who don\\'t care about them. This guy. #jetblue I shouldn\\'t be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now. why would you hire a guy who doesn\\'t care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. what\\'s up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting. For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question. JetBlue rocks! never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you\\'re still nothing it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you. you\\'ve let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven a 5 year old can\\'t sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue of my tray table is broken what do i do? Domestic. To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding? Thanks! thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable! the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn\\'t trending is how you know I\\'m loyal ;) 5 hours delayed now in hour increments? Really? as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday? no, I haven\\'t done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx! woof I\\'m on the red cArpet No wifi on this flight so we can\\'t tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet SEA✈️BOS Thank you for the reply. Would\\'ve appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to What confirmation number? You also promised to change my wife\\'s name on the account and it is also not done. WTF? You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account. They are still NOT there! 1/2 btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month\\'s aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock follow for DM please oh. And thank you for responding where is it coming from? I thought Tampa? Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can\\'t seem to get an answer thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in. is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add to my JB Flight Booking Problems ? You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of .... at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination? thank you guys! You are the best! 🙌✈️ You just don\\'t get it. It\\'s not about the money, It\\'s about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue. why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn\\'t that a bit stupid? check-in headaches! does not fit in 140 love it as always! You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 \"goodwill credit\" will make everything hunky-dory. You blew it. every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble?? As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. hey awesome peeps, what\\'s up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs? is there wifi on he plain what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon! Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕 What\\'s up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness! wondering if it\\'s possible for my colleague and I to get on an earlier flight LAX&gt;JFK tomorrow. Can you help? 118 to Boston still sitting now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan 🌴 thanks for replying-I feel a little better we\\'ll see how it goes ☺️✈️ I usually do-but I didn\\'t make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that\\'ll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕 early last month via Expedia-there\\'s an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name backlog is an hour at most, this is over two! Unacceptable!! your agent told us TSA didn\\'t have a crew to get bags! you guys rock! my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ☺👍👍 Awesome! #bestairlineever no baggage crew update! Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours.... the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI is blaming for flight 584 luggage debacle! #luggagegate Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though I look forward to that do much! w/ edits: Dear , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them? of course I am!!✈️ You failed. That\\'s the answer. Please don\\'t justify otherwise. come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip. When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ. I only fly Jet Blue Perhaps you need to start recruiting ;) Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I\\'m all in thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free? flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great! still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row. thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I\\'ll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business I shouldn\\'t have to find them, they should tell us. I\\'ve flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn\\'t what it was. if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time? I\\'m over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey. If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don\\'t buy it. our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun. I don\\'t believe so. That\\'s not what the team has told us. also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight. #1691 out of JFK. no one has info no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot everyone is cranky I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections. Please help! any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home. Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!! Just wrong. No excuses. Figure it out expect the unexpected I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time! “@JetBlue: Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! Enjoy the ride!” Thank you! My wife was with our dog. They wouldn\\'t even let her out off the plane. My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong According to your ground staff, it hasn\\'t even been taken off the plane yet! .@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations At what time? All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it\\'s back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology? thanks! Have a good Sunday. Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers? 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed saved all trip 2 sit again? flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy... it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed. His name is Enzo 😊 Well hello there pooch! What\\'s your name? #dog I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the \"T5 experience\" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month. Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won\\'t start. It that weather reLate Flightd as well. These passengers on plane for 10 hrs. thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children. Promo Watch Phone $33 at Amazon check your hold music sucks. Customer of the year? JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too. no excuse though for 3 gate changes though. if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped. get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!? nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can\\'t believe I paid money for this. thank you. We are finally at the gate. flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they\\'ve made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?! don\\'t I always? Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane! too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You\\'re in league with big alcohol. Shame on you. thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What\\'s the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you. they were amazing and thank you! and have empty \"help\" desks there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there when will the system be up and running? Thanks for the THIRD gate change “@JetBlue: Beautiful shot.. Thanks for sharing. Using #FlyFi to post? ;)” Your welcome! Not on this flight. It was a quickie;) Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We\\'re making a pact to never fly u again 795 to Austin she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock! what happened to our plane meant to leave 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather. where is the \"award winning service\"? really not acceptable. Just informed plane won\\'t start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk. how much longer to JFK open\\'s I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don\\'t have nothing flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It\\'s 36 and sunny at JFK u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue? unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn\\'t get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email. Thank you your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!! just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up it\\'s sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What\\'s the real reason? thanks for the info. Already doing it now before we board! Looking forward to the future upgrades! #JetBlue things happen it\\'s ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport it\\'s been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous. any idea when the flight will actually take off? I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers. Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks what\\'s the delay if the system isn\\'t down? Not blaming Jet Blue. This wasn\\'t weather. Can\\'t have planes in the air and runways a mess. That\\'s a disaster waiting to happen. don\\'t think any1 rly knows what\\'s goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12 That is not very gracious of to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours. and ask she load the bag for my flight after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards get flight 16 into the air That\\'s not weather reLate Flightd. You are just being nice and blaming the weather. Airport just wasn\\'t prepared. Investigation time. if I had my tux, it\\'d be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it I\\'m also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT.... It\\'s not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job here\\'s part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn\\'t print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass it\\'s only because I\\'m wearing #TrueBlueColors! flight16? That\\'s not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway. When it\\'s 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as \"on time\" #updateyourwebsite #489 whatever your lil #mint heart desires! how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really? Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue seriously? System down? No IT? yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great! just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I\\'ll document and send details, off to Boston flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we\\'re getting on have a cpap machine for sleep apnea. Is this OK to carry on if I also have a small bag for clothes? got it. thanks the quick reply. isn\\'t this something YOU should do?! Why should I tell your crew how to do their job? your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks! had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I\\'ll keep my fingers crossed. Charleston - from your app guys as of a few minutes ago!!! thx, social media person!

What can I say other than when it comes to my #BrandLoveAffair w/ ur my #soulandinspiration #umosaicmecrazy Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can\\'t we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY! you want me to talk to the wall? Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks. Its poor Flight management.

Have family driving 90 min to pick me up from Erie think flight - what if Cancelled Flighted? best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won\\'t put you standby? #stranded yes, they said the runway isn\\'t ready and they\\'re waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight. I travel for business twice a week and after the fiasco, I\\'ll be flying blue more often. Thanks. we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information? won\\'t see my money again after their poor service should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue??? suck and their customer services are the worst whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don\\'t honor #badairline I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight? FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting to speak to a human at customer service how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system.

I was on seat 17A thank you very much. I left my personal stuff on US4551 from PHL-BOS about an hour ago. Went baggage, was told plane left to call 800# - First impressions are hard to reverse.

My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren\\'t for a family emergency, I\\'d Cancelled Flight. ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United sadly that didn\\'t help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there!

They might be oversized If I’m unable to use my departing flight can I still use the returning flight? Is it possible to Cancelled Flight my reservation online? I\\'ve been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate. Been on hold for over 5 hours!

Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt I\\'m glad retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent.

When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your \"go to\" maneuver? see you on board tomorrow Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed. This type of service in not acceptable. been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. charges a reasonable $50. i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online.... another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to \"bad weather\" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone? OK we are on DAY 11 trying to book a flight for 4. Ur system STILL says \"due to weather….call back Late Flightr\" #outofbusiness ? Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation. You all are the best for this. Could not have done it without you. our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating! Your policy needs a serious revision for babies. Fortunately I have choices and choose from here on out. still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service. they have all of this at hotels. Still don\\'t have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn\\'t fix the problem There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I\\'m flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC??? Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn\\'t been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst been trying for weeks no use should give me free baggage for this mess Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE. I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies realize that transfers should be possible for tickets I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏 seriously??? did you not see that I\\'ve spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours? Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!! How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation? can i please have someone call me 781 879 4505 We\\'re back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we\\'ll get thete eventually. So thanks. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature! 1 flight Cancelled Flightled yesterday and now a delay today has robbed my daughter of 2 days with her grandparents. Thanks 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q\\'d to take off. And we checked our bags. can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please. need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23. Horrible attitudes toward helping customers. Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever. knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!! why aren\\'t you updating flight status/delays? They\\'re also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you\\'re not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out nope, they just announced we\\'re headed back to the gate. pretty sure we didn\\'t actually take off at 7:10 well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I\\'ve wasted. I\\'ve got a job family this is crazy 5203 and we\\'re just sitting 20 feet from an open gate just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online what\\'s wrong with the plane?

I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours. My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I\\'m supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought. Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn\\'t have done it without you. it\\'s not like I\\'m trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don\\'t want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU. some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love They\\'re flexible not trying to take all my $.

They didn\\'t schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail yes but again valuable time has been lost I don\\'t like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I\\'ve been stuck in CA all day and should\\'ve been home by now. You owe me. yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am. the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH can\\'t get back lost time flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces. Ur fired - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution? my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don\\'t have it?

Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare? Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death. A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period. I submitted a doctor\\'s note. I\\'ve never been treated this badly I\\'m glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems. Three months and my miles haven\\'t been credited. No one is going to read the email I sent. My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It\\'s been three months and my miles My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight No one picks up the phone all day/ no opportunity to leave a voicemail Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open -- My request to merge the accounts is denied No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don\\'t want this blasting here. I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont\\' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card - I had 20,748 miles in my account and was informed I\\'d forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I - It\\'s all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I\\'m having screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn\\'t let me on the plane because we were (1/4) Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold not yet. But we will see shortly. I\\'ve flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words. flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help. honestly - how is it quickly as possible I\\'ve been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else. done it! Process initiated Saturday morning. Can\\'t get info with website issues inadequate phone coverage. How 2 get update?? yay for glitchy tracking system! My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said! really??? NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it\\'s 11:30pm #NoExcuses yeah I know that but that doesn\\'t get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! “@USAirways: We don\\'t have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.” Everyone is sorry. Don\\'t have what I need for meeting tomorrow. 140 charac. isn\\'t nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they\\'ll Cancelled Flight my whole flight. if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer? #disappointed thank u i wiil write after call travel agency terrible service Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person, Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I\\'m a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues! - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account. my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person. cust svc means nothing! So disappointed.

You have zero respect for your passengers. I\\'m officially done flying with you. has the worst customer service line. I\\'ve called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being. that wasn\\'t the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won\\'t let me process my request. SMH you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this. ... I f@$%ing hate you. travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund Yes have already spent 1K+ on the card paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks. yes, with Delta! well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable. yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request.. 50 mins Late Flightr nothing! Not good. On hold for over an hour. Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts? no worries, your flight attendant took care of it. Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone I\\'ve been on hold for over an hour. Not doing so well in the customer service department. #weak - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation? there are breastfeeding momma\\'s watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown I\\'ve fulfilled all reqs.

I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain it\\'s no wonder you had to sell hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow. did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time. and - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys. #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously? Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow. 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights? #NoService good luck trying to reach a human! Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins... #neveragain every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola. is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening good work by flight 1798 crew. #Chairman\\'s recognition even in coach. Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly. What\\'s up with this? changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to now having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never. I can\\'t wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work? sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways. It\\'s very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don\\'t answer the phone I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help I have better Intel than she does! She said plane is due in at 630. Flightaware and your own app say 645 not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn\\'t departed. Too little, too Late Flight. You suck Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options. Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you? should, but didn’t. just now but no general announcement what\\'s going on with US Airways flight 805? Why diverted to Charlotte? I’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely relevant schedule to prevent this in the future. i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip what\\'s up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18? Nice customer service. very embarrassing. I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler. yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this? I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight. 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues. i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them. and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits... please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS has me on my toes whether I\\'m going to make my flight back to Boston tonight need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose #rude explain how come I can get a free upgrade on US as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight. #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold? I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. Thank you. I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address? there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy can you help me out? is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened. i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks. well there is certainly nothing happening \"in front\" of the scenes. #Noaccountability #disappointing 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can\\'t get a response after a week. Unacceptable customer service at its best! Rachel S. took great care of us at the PHX airport. planes in #grandcayman I will never fly us airways again. strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4. Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays Can you follow, so I can DM you? so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don\\'t have enough hours together. Fail yes, thanks but took forever as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news! horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn\\'t get on the 4:05 I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not? while I’m asking… 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came greeted me thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat. 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination. it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: being argued with. I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice. but question if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? .@USAirways Have you just given up? .@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME. Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA) Your \"moveup\" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am... Great management of twitter account. Thank you. why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app? I am good. I just did not understand the terminology. but the merger brings new verbiage can you priv chat to help chairman reroute New marketing song? let us know what you think? why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways can you help chairman? I am on flight 686 PHX connect 599 SJC will miss connection can you reroute please. your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU that\\'s a lie. also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, picked \"Standby for 1st\" I was not put on the list? your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me. do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls! And you took away my 1st class seat. Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time. PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help! is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach? THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me. ok thanks no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.

Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with and - can you please put me on one of those? awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH? I\\'ll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks. ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day. - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos. on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn\\'t offered. Awful service continues. I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines. I checked in \"Standby for 1st Class\" only to find I am \"not on the list\". This merger is a pain. 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you! been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now. honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600????? how does one downgrade a flight? I\\'m shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land. You have 2 hours. only happened because u couldn\\'t get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags I will never fly again the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do.

Would like to reiterate that I was thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on. and I would have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and say we misunderstood each other until he went on a look out for flying rocks this time! It\\'s a bird it\\'s a plane! Nah never mind it\\'s just a rock... doesn\\'t take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me. you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them this is no way to treat women. I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable. citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended. Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I\\'m so upset really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday. we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright Am I allowed to carry on a suit bag and carry on bag?

I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off what happens if it isn\\'t located I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me so it\\'s a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight? is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David. if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don\\'t like being told how lousy your service is. you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before. cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix?

Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down! just an FYI I\\'ll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got. you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly. if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it? customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I\\'m sure TSA would. I find it funny that responds but you don\\'t. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down. I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today. slowest baggage claim ever Don\\'t blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather. Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility too Late Flight. delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that\\'s true I never want to fly US Airways again shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!) made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help! how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that? im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times It\\'s 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully. - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-) US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr. you guys lost my luggage US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr. US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances. thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn\\'t get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen! US 728. Refuel; we\\'ve sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. \"Look, over there to the left!\" Actual announcement. thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We\\'re a nonprofit-can\\'t you make an exception? How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x US 728. One water run of the planet\\'s smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment. US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet\\'s smallest water bottles. US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.) US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us. US 728 returned to gate to get \"MEL\" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone? I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment. US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard. US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we\\'re not hearing from pilot for long periods. Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I\\'ve ever been in. No leg room! #dividendsmember One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won\\'t be any good publicity... US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange. my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand. can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic \"sorry\" email back take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules. back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn\\'t help. One person in front of me 20 min wait again? So you understand why I\\'m resorting to Twitter: No help available at gate while this occurred or by phone afterward. going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please! I\\'m expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box. what\\'s the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac? stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help. You can do better than that. really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx. well that is not going to help. I\\'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs my client wants his ff nbr in the record he\\'s elite wAA hi. You lost my father\\'s wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me. 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv CTL . CTL JAN . JAN CTL . CTL GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go. is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them. yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on. Row 16, flight 634 today if you\\'re looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need. seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground! I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers. why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour the pilot doesn\\'t know when we\\'ll leave. anyone there to help? Still on hold... oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest. site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX. is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given. flights \"customer relations\" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents! - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry now on hold with customer care. Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm. when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information. lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA. your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time. Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! 👍 usually \"sorry\" doesn\\'t involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that\\'s a club perk. don\\'t worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold. Sorry #minefits horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday? booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost no ownership from They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you. Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn\\'t work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody... okay, great. Thank you! now my rebooked connection is delayed. I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!! And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered? any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online? takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail how long for a reply Bag policy says stroller OR car seat. We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller. Should I just call for details? it was customer service like I have never seen before! Kudos to your organization. Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover? And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways how do I get a hold of customer service? I\\'ve called multiple times have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I\\'ve been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane .@USAirways Can\\'t book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help? / was the worst experience I\\'ve ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text? called 3x it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me? grrrrrrrr. Couldn\\'t book a flight via calling either delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077 Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever. she will be reaching out to you!

Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail I\\'m sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times thanks for a subpar travel experience and it\\'s not even over yet #stepitup FYI your customer service rep Carol is an absolute delight.

Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside out. #NotHappy then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!! so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren\\'t here 45 minutes Late Flightr wow, awful customer service. merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it. How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls? YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏 flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you. 4469, thank you for asking. three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!? on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can\\'t say enough great things about our pilot. He\\'s doing all he can for us. What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait. Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again. you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me. I\\'ve flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime. This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒 your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that. Go extinct. A merger only delays the inevitable What was the point of the merger? Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore? I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form. You guys are the best Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up. Recommend a call back feature. IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY??? SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR??? not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website. Can you help? how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems? Please don\\'t trivialize me. This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long? sorry doesn\\'t help. It\\'s midnight PST. How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line? Like I thought this was America. When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia? you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest. At least they treat their customers properly. But nope! Apparently this is the way you guys do business! I guess I\\'m flying southwest and her blue from now on. I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight. there\\'s over 50 people in line and only one agent! And by the way, I\\'m planning it while I\\'ve Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour! Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area. I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways. and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me! you guys are the worst airline I\\'ve ever dealt with. No notifications, no keeping customers updated. Terrible service hey guys! Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST! any progress? Good luck, Patrick! he\\'s fine, he really likes picking his own seat.... is the worst airline to ever travel with. has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled. Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don\\'t care????!!! now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep? who\\'s in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight the call hung up on me.. got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!! yet again your staff in Philadelphia failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible Number or email? That\\'s the purpose of sending you a tweet? Thank you. I\\'ll do that next time! it still says that I can\\'t check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn\\'t left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights. had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh does anyone from your airline know how to do their job? Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡 denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg you reminded me today why I fly looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks! .... I\\'ve been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous you are the worst. making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn\\'t happen... not given option for new flight!

Cool. Now has been told you can\\'t re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race. quick, let\\'s board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails Also, get excited, because he\\'s going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me. flight 705 FRA-CAT did some odd zig-zagging movements over Frankfurt... Is everything ok? It\\'s pretty hilarious that you want to finish his awful experience before doing something. Make it right, now. u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you\\'d rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that. dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it\\'s not in system. Need help ASAP. Got it, thanks! Umm, can you define \\'extra time\\'? International Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes... Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do? landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now? I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks! flight 849\\'s four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter. I did at 7 pm! Still no bag.. Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up. Congrats, you\\'ve just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold $25. So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number? Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic I\\'ve been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call? ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we\\'ve been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight! hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream. Can you help me update KTN on the profile? Ticket book via AA that info didn\\'t get pass on. I\\'ve been on hold forever so you\\'re not honoring miles with that were traveled last year? you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour? so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards miles on usair. Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service. It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea? I\\'m glad you\\'re sorry that I\\'m homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure. but in the meantime I\\'ll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st. Thanks guys! ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you\\'ll be getting the bill wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief. but don\\'t worry! They found a hotel, it\\'s only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem. at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn\\'t fast enough the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to \"go left\" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami. No worries I was able to read entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs then zip flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours. refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn\\'t even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn\\'t allow to make change online? Your team needs to build capacity I will write CR. Not sure what good it\\'ll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible. -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won\\'t go-HELP!!! Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough fuck you. I\\'m dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles😡. #wasteoftime #theworst worst customer service I\\'ve ever experienced. I\\'ll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you. Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ? now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather? - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks Kudos to Robin at Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with! Website won\\'t let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help. you were always my go to. What happened? Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service? trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help! Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation? would be less annoying if road conditions weren\\'t getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason. experience exceptional service from Cherry at #DenverAirport. #GreatService. #professionalism literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I have flown a lot I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP? figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke 45 minutes on hold no help transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help! me too! flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now? you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That\\'s pretty awesome if you ask me... express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family that\\'s who I spoke to already. We\\'ve already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your concern. Just wanted to talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn\\'t help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing. i thought was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is the only decent airline out there? I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story! #Creditcardsales 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands... US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I\\'ve never been booked twice Already tried. How about Conf # via DM new slogan should be \"if you don\\'t want to arrive on time, pick us\" you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail they weren\\'t able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents Jeanine I will send an email with details Late Flightr. Thank you for responding. This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that! did I mention I\\'m a silver preferred member and fly every week (not always with you), and not even a meal voucher? Need to change div miles ticket after travel started due to weather advisory. Told not possible unless flight Cancelled Flightled. AnyHelp? I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm. Instead I\\'m now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow I\\'m stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside Just to follow up here is my experience: / are incompetent. Now the next plane had a broken seat! My row!

Thanks again this week. #daddyshome worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together. I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn\\'t customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it\\'s brutal! im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It\\'s just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out. them and rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing. I did was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle. Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don\\'t have seats. Never flying again here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain it\\'s not misjudging it\\'s a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week. stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company. you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn\\'t even until June. will do. maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered yep, check it and my gmail \\'Promotions\\' folder regularly... is a bag that is 23”L x 9”W x 12”H allowed as a carry on? thanks for nothing there is nothing tonight and I am on the flight now with GOGO internet is there a way that someone could send me a DM or email? 2 bad planes 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let\\'s hope this plane works. I\\'m tired. Good info, but am already signed up for all options. None of which sound like they applied to the \\'missing\\' emails. is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight? thank you and please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. \"Please wait\" then same form. found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times. Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I\\'m appalled. I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone. if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I’ll ride US for life It\\'s a debit card, but I am a Dividend member. nothing important to do. Why was I told to wait in the line? #patiencerunningout How do I redeem my pass to the admirals club? I have 1 free visit with my barclay card membership. And can I bring a companion? Almost home ...East Coast Freeze headed to PHL connect AVP TGIF can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip Is it insulting that offer a \"non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn\\'t posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen? I\\'m trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can\\'t my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number. flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn\\'t seem to be anyone\\'s concern. how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow\\'s trip. Do they not get sent now? link didn\\'t work via Mobil. Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up. I\\'m not a frequent flyer with US airways, I\\'m qantas? Can I still get notifications? Thank you How do I get through? who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend? Yes thank you. Appreciate u checking... why I can\\'t book a flight to PRN through your website? this is ridiculous #planebroken can\\'t wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab Yes, it was Sunday. since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I\\'m confused since we had sunny skies I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW! who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay? more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing. I\\'m enjoying my flights so far! You\\'re doing a great job. Today\\'s been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable. look has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. That\\'s not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can\\'t help me? if I have Dividend Miles credit card I used it to book my flight is one bag free? have checked all day. CHO needs added. Please evaluate. hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic? can u tell me if 5238 from clt to Jan has gotten out of the gate yet?

Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her have scheduled flight Sat(2morrow) CHO-CLT CHO needs to be added to weather advisory. Please evaluate asap. another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY it\\'s painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail will shall see in the next couple of minutes. right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm. I did, but i need to get a human being. What\\'s the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer. - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding. Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed! sure, just DM\\'ed you. also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer. #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door! and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what? Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly. Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly. I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks! fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I\\'m stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed. sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing Know what I like about gate 35X ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways I\\'ve tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans. it\\'s vegas baby who doesn\\'t have a good time in vegas lol me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on March 7th since couldn\\'t get any out of tricities here in Tn worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it\\'s \"not worth it\" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS see? No response? Obviously you think this \"service\" is acceptable. #customerservicefail “@USAirways: We\\'re sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone\\'s call and we appreciate your patience.” #false absolutely It wasn\\'t weather this morning. AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues. So far lost one of 3 days I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to and they keep sending me to you! no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don\\'t care how many points he has! He only has we have seats. on phone Iwas told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right? waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim! awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you\\'re interested. flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me? i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you will you please start offering more routes out of to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta Welcome to North Texas US Air / American Air employees. Housing and Education are great opportunities in The GR8 State Of Texas oh they saw it and said nothing. yes but lost a whole day.

Your sites tell me my info don\\'t match even though I can\\'t find a difference. yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service can I bring mini bottles of booze on to my flight? your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag. Not happy with start of trip! Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice Nice try. Doesn\\'t apply to Philly. what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board? Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it! I\\'m glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available. Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon? how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor? I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists. Your systems don\\'t make it easy for the customer to access it. awesome! And yes, is! that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter.

I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I\\'ve since learned had one! Yes, I get that. I’m asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I’ve given you? delayed I\\'m charlotte big surprise Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could\\'ve handed this one better. same here! On hold for an hour then told has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL?

Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I\\'ll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA. We\\'ve been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn\\'t that have been done b4 we got on???? Thank you can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx Reservation agent on the phone did a great job. get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes.

What will you do with my feedback? has no idea what customer service means. As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don\\'t treat me like its no big deal! Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares? how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707? I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI! I fly quite a bit, and it\\'s not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what\\'s happening, arrangements can be made Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I\\'m so displeased. headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more). made it!!! Send Bloody Mary\\'s to row 27!!! 5223 out of Gainesville, FL I already let them know and sent 4 complaints. Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back # Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it? the flights weren\\'t from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I\\'m a platinum member with AA and feel like it\\'s worthless never let\\'s me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed. sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection Done made it.. Never ran so fast in my life I\\'ve been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! Thanks, but you can\\'t. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for \"maintenance\" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me. yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route. 835, fix this ASAP No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated.\" , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?! I\\'m logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony. You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time. #HappyFriday big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman\\'s desk. Top tier customer service today. #outstanding #service #support. now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal. are you fucking kidding me??? now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn\\'t help. This is terrible. what is the damn delay???? it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here app is the worst one for airlines. Can\\'t do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless. has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday! And also, it\\'s great that you tweet complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless. .@USAirways You\\'ll be receiving a long detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again. thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day 4:30am for nothing! need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there\\'s a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours! that the flight was delayed closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout I appreciate your prompt response. nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn\\'t even pay for Choice well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on. I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable doesn\\'t seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn\\'t help #usairwaysfail this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight. the plane is moving and it\\'s no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open. of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ⛄️☀️ nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn\\'t even pay. is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half. Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super. I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight. this is so unacceptable. I\\'m going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn\\'t even let us off. hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! ordered a Scotch water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that???? yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we\\'re an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today. we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class. Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O\\'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We\\'ve heard it all! #LetsGo \"Able\"? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won\\'t fit overhead? 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50 is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue. is the worst!! Still haven\\'t left.. Everyone missing connections. today\\'s flight to Philadelphia. It\\'s a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it\\'s not even snowing in FL. I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven\\'t talked to a human. can you help me reroute my trip? gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston I\\'m in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo! on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!! thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight. I am so going to miss US Airways. You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN. NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. .@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm. 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more! this response doesn\\'t correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience! it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due to mechanical. never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service. Mobile boarding pass email. we will...sunday! Just a few days away I am following you now unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn\\'t be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time. I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven\\'t left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience. Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable. offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!! “@USAirways: We\\'re excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?” Spring Break !!! still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What\\'s up? that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌 that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us that\\'s incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice Exicted to be flying with y\\'all soon !! and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons. the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to \"choose\" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better. now the freezing bus is just doing circles? please explain, I have plenty of time since I\\'m STRANDED!! I doubt that, its 11:21p we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice. why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket? 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up? we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary. doesn\\'t want me to get home They don\\'t stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway? DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt 1 announcement 4 hour! - I bet you don\\'t, but I\\'m the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you. I can\\'t even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket. oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving. Flight 1137 has been awful that\\'s the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge. never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays. my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help! the flight that I did not connect to was 1857. even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won\\'t be that difficult am sure #disappointed yes .not sure how you guys don\\'t know gate is occupied and keep us waiting Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment. - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I\\'ve come to expect. you gladly take the loyal customer\\'s money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused. the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people\\'s memories! You should be ashamed! 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service?? due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help! we can\\'t afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can\\'t afford to go home. but it\\'s not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really? ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded. FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab! An asset to your team. From 1F. Have a great night team! thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa We\\'re having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares! See you Saturday! Thank you, Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than and Thank you! You won me over! flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives??? I already HAVE, four times 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you\\'re understaffed. I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do? I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail! Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn\\'t eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn\\'t need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can\\'t think@of even ONE. #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on It\\'s been 6 days. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there! problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways 5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested. Deal w this!! flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave! When will it be marked \"completed\". I\\'m scared I\\'m going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded. completed. If that\\'s the case then why does it still say \"in progress\" on Paypal\\'s website. I reserved on the 13th. So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted they said my reservation is Appreciate the calls when flight\\'s delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious just goes on on. I vote for texts if practical HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful. Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty? we got our bags today. Thanks! 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status. never fails to disappoint. platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can\\'t I check in for flight tomorrow? your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500. flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD. Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I’ve been on flight 1776 from BOS —&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam? Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!! pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn\\'t just be throwing them on the cart. no problem. Things worked out at airport. Thanks! any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or... please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits. i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues should take a lesson from and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame.. Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ? do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning. yes, it\\'s a domestic flight. Thank you! can I bring a copy or photo of my baby\\'s birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing. would like to see you do similar in PHL! thanks! Made it safely! they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today tells me to talk to about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight? this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything. 4420 delayed further? 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there. .@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full. 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡 just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member. - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix, thanks. If you have another method also that would be nice. Appears to be a design flaw yes. Every one of these on every flight is like this. There needs to be more Velcro or something please secure the \\'footrest\\' shelf\\' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay. Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew! FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don\\'t create policy. But it\\'s an undue penalty for a job req\\'ing flexibility is there anyway to get rebook in help on twitter? why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS. not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I\\'ll keep you posted I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend\\'s wedding! #strandedattheairport how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with silicon valleys only 10 day film festival poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more I\\'m not patient. I\\'m annoyed. If you can\\'t book this travel online, then you shouldn\\'t make people wait on the phone. US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please “@USAirways: Thanks for your feedback, Alan.” Thx, but no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt I don\\'t think the US site allows that (unlike Can I use a US credit if I held on lol me too still waiting on a response - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can\\'t be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website. so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers How will I change it? oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better. a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby? thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection! I just think it\\'s weird to have mileage as 666 flight 1783 CLT to BOS Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can\\'t sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed. but you guys switched me and didn\\'t inform me of the chathes worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice your app is bad, and you should feel bad. Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with with no warning. Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well? is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. I hope you can fix it Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft. yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home. has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible Will you be destroying lives in Eastern during this lively little event? For profits you will. 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService been with US Airways since 03, back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way. understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn\\'t have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight. we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven\\'t changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane. 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people exec bene\\'s not honored no problem...just funny have a nice day yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18 Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy. a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y\\'all merged? My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times... even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO 😂😂😂😂 No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable. over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter can you DM me add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight? now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck! some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative I feel sorry for AA there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!! “@USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from I look 4ward to that follow back too! what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797 THE END: Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from You should join us: Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to \"maintenance\".

SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?! is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. I\\'ve been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful I have a party of 4 booked for a flight in Aug. At 10:05am, how can I find out how much it would cost to change to an earlier fl 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled. Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous! Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can\\'t change reservation online.

What is your policy? 657. My daughter Candice and I are together with her baby. sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue? How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often... if you could change your name to and do what they do...that\\'d be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings. #tbt every day. what\\'s the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight? got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated if you\\'ve got room on an earlier flight home, why charge me $75 to get on it? Be the hero!

He\\'s a great guy, good crew, he\\'s just, err, single. any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA? Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours will these prices be honored?

Yes, understand non transferable understood and so does us airways. Getting through tsa is the problem I paid for my seat. I expect to be able to use my full seat if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse? #nothappy so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff the gate agent said \"it\\'s booked in full. Sorry\" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land. Empty 1st class, Chairman can\\'t move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again! can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can\\'t change ticket name.. you\\'re the only airline that\\'s not open sooner. It\\'s not a confidence booster. checked in last night airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen? new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can\\'t get through TSA cardholder is flying. We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating. I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card, do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent. 130am flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights.. thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account.. a long, incredibly frustrating day no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn\\'t have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help Been dealing w/ to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV Will do Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the merger. #USAirways thank you.

Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags - done i was told my ticket expired but i never recvd any notice before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles $125 for the tckt captain on flight 1712 from PHX-PHL at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. \"Greetings from the pointy end of the airplane\" haha thanks! just noticed that I don\\'t believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend? worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude unacceptable #fail any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card. got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles? “@USAirways: We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto.

Didn\\'t get in til 5 sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight. #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!! please go to a gate. This is absurd. will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit? 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported. lost our luggage. #yay I found a flight I want on Is my AA Advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you\\'re merging? really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night.

My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay. yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. please follow me so I can DM you about something 4 flights in 48hrs I\\'ve had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she\\'s great. landed safely everything worked out. can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I\\'m dumb and should be using a different airline #wth you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it\\'s middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient. delays to the max on Sunday! Can\\'t wait! See you then well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy it shouldn\\'t take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details. Called twice and disconnected. Emailed them a week ago and still nothing... I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! does not! help! yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE still waiting! Captain reports he\\'s called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa. finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again so what is the difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee? on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done I have been doing that all day. Can\\'t find my bag anywhere bc they\\'re saying it was never scanned technically never left LAX. why no ground crew at DCA when we\\'re already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr being told \\'tough break and this is how it is\\' is unacceptable. You can\\'t even tell me when my bags will be here ice cream up front! Solid shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout now telling me I don\\'t have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!! Your software is broken. \"Call Customer Support\" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers. It\\'s not double booked. I spoke with CS and we\\'ve got a plan to fix this. It\\'s still an amateur mistake that should never happen. is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit? delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I\\'ll probably be taking my business elsewhere. ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa. I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight? so far I\\'ve gotten six different answers Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double. I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! what\\'s going on? I\\'ve been hearing a not-friendly \\'Please wait\\' on repeat while I\\'m on hold, being transferred to idk where... The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around. That\\'s not good. I\\'m sorry as well. It\\'s been 24 hrs without my bag and I can\\'t get a straight answers. I\\'m on call #6 for today. Ya\\'ll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs. I wish we were on our way. Now there\\'s a problem w/de-icing.Three 1/2 hour delay so far sill not sure if we\\'ll be taking off. if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn\\'t be stuck in horrible CLT now. you run a piece of shit airline!! Thanks for ruining AA “@USAirways: We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code? Finally back on board. Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us? sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting. my TSA precheck isn\\'t showing up on my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow...help!? #USAirways #TSAPreCheck I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please pass along my feedback. I\\'ve tried calling about 15 times in 4 days Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly. PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier. That\\'s so wrong I\\'m delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga. Not good we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool she missed her uncle\\'s funeral, and you \"hope\" they can find another flight. That\\'s very considerate of you. My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I\\'m very disappointed. just lost a faithful customer. I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! #ThankYouForEverything Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins. Now flight further delayed. Don\\'t lite a match either Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided. it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys well this is about as worthless as your regular service. A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn\\'t ready after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic that\\'s understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is! we haven\\'t departed yet so let\\'s not get too high hopes. But everything has been on schedule so far Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC. your app sucks balls compared to #USAirways So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR Thanks. Suggestion: stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music a msg that says \"call volume is high.\" #vrm \"admirals club\" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!! to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile I paid for my ticket on on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account. ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow. this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew? my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485 Looking forward to some friends and family time in Arizona. no they dont. I think I already said that. No one responds. Its an auto response. Wait is this an auto response?????? First Class all the way!!💺✈️ Headed to started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck us2118 My wife in Boston says no snow right now. I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don\\'t care you see now that is a lie. They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. I appreciate the hard work the push to b better thanks for giving away my seat. Another fine job! how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it\\'s not actually snowing in Boston? Usair flight 2218 #US2218 I\\'ve been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering. thanks. You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again... thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there\\'s heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes? I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks! stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again What\\'s the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don\\'t scan it for tracking? No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease you can\\'t even track my bag to see where it is. It\\'s like it\\'s disappeared. Can\\'t get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It\\'s been over a month since travel I\\'ve submitted twice online I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !! is there gonna be a better day to call? I\\'ve called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person. I spent more on the room transportation then I did the whole flight I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off. I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do? so mad I can\\'t even believe you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, give me a useless hotel voucher Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour a half? I\\'d like an answer. I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges I\\'ve done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don\\'t understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting. that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) turns into with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn\\'t be more unhelpful. Why Yes but I will nvr fly w/ I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn\\'t see my father be4 they put him in a coma 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks thanks! Can you help remind the agents it\\'s ok? Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn\\'t get home until midnight. #NeverAgain the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone. would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold? would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation? would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold? a $100 - totaled. Not happy. Not at all. I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply\\'s #usairwaysssuck the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is \"I don\\'t really know what happened\" .@USAirways thanks! my number is 214-725-1966. CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks Have him call me. I cant wait to see if anything happens. Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! #lucycat we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! (although we\\'re not sure what a timbit is...) Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!! Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets? I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase. would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again? booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone? YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices. Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible that\\'s ok, just know that I\\'ll most likely never book with you again I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around. Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck I don\\'t mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn\\'t have had to. The airport has more room and you know.. food! That is appreciated. However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call. No need to reply, thanks. why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process? I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options Yeah I know that...but now I\\'ll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through. Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in \\'y\\'? There isn\\'t a ticket number...the transaction is still pending. do families no longer get early boarding with young kids? American, your new parent, gives it to us... not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41. your agent did not say no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy? It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself that link is broken. But if it\\'s the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information. Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I\\'m still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up thanks for reaching out to me. My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V. stranded in Philly- #Starving and can\\'t get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue / next flight in 10 hrs On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min counting yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it\\'s not flailing about. link doesn\\'t work and I\\'ve tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn\\'t clarify where it is. thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now! Thank you!!! On our way to get her bag now - thanks to having that number 😊 how do you give stand by seats to ticketed passengers who you know have a connecting flight ? Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly? All the people missed there connections and there\\'s only 2. Spend 1 HOUR on hold with . why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have a connection? last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged. No one answers the baggage call line for status? #chairmanlove this is crazy. Haven\\'t spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL. you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance! I\\'ve been trying for DAYS! And I don\\'t get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts. What am I to do?? Why not have an option for a call back? I\\'m just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed. 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can\\'t even fix it. Worst service I\\'ve ever had I\\'ve been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really? A global company? Help! Also, we are in family crisis you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies. where\\'s my apology? Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn\\'t talk 2 a REAL person kept getting disconnected by an automated msg. flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help? new tag line \"but we got you there alive!\" 2 days in a row I call and still can\\'t get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees? announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane gate, but it was a \\'direct flight\\' #logic just realized my advantage number wasn\\'t used for my flight. How do I get my ff miles? Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$? Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight. flight is delayed 5 hours. No reason given. Sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke So we got her home, now we just need her bag. Is there a direct desk number for Savannah? I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren\\'t sure what city my bag was in. Thank you, busy times. My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a \"sorry for your inconvenience\" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed 90 min delay thanks to \"maintenance issues\". Thanks for wasting a day. Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ⤵ thanks thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways through, can you confirm that I haven\\'t been charged? Hey! I booked a flight (Isabelle Gramp, Boston to LAX), and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction didn\\'t go YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME BACK, PLEASE!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 I\\'ve been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that\\'s after being hung up on the first time. is useless airways. Day 2 trying to get home on standby as a result of their Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways This is how vacations get Cancelled Flightled been on hold ⤵for 40+ minutes still havent talked to anyone. #failure for a response in 3-4 days? No thanks will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour thanks so much! I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that? No, this is a systemic problem. Mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but USAirways SPF record disallows it. DM me for more detail little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete. I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight a months ago I used my old license do I need to change that? we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you aren\\'t the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease still can\\'t get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes has an SPF record error that is causing e-mail from noreply@usairwaysmobile.com to go to spam filters. DNS admin needs to fix! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... ,@USAirways 2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I\\'m not patient. I have no choice. #Antitrust issue my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone! Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I\\'ve missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations. I don\\'t need to rebook I need to know the policy No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can\\'t afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit. what are the odds you can get me on a flight with delta so I can actually get to Orlando today?? #2daysLate Flight we\\'re all standing here and no one is saying anything. I\\'ll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. How long does it take to receive ticket # from for itin booked via on US flights? that is the most useless tweet I\\'ve ever seen out of you. this is got to be the worst service I\\'ve ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed so you\\'re going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that\\'s part of the problem now over 2 hrs. Can\\'t wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways I\\'ve called for 3 days and can\\'t get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn\\'t result in you hanging up on me? what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed? I just checked in online for tomorrow\\'s flight - thought I should get auto upgrade? (Already got the email saying no seats) last name Pordes tell reservations to rebook me from 5080 to 5129 why aren\\'t twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?! still not in the air for deicing of plane. I\\'ll miss connect but customer service was helpful.I\\'m hoping to catch the next flight Trying to go Nashville to London and just have no idea when would be a good time to fly out of Nashville right now. #usairways #unacceptable #holdtime REALLY?! what do I push to rebook with that 800 number tell the flight from clt to srq 5080 to wait!!!!!! they lost my bag baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera if there are empty first class seats on my flight at check in, why wouldn\\'t I be automatically upgraded? grades for this trip: Flight timeliness: 👎✈️ Cancelled Flightations: 👎😬 Customer Service: 👎😡 Flight attendants: 😊👏 Thanks means a lot after I was verbally cussed out, charged extra for a bag, then told \" I don\\'t feel like dealing with it\" 😒 stuck in cae need reFlight Booking Problems for next flight possibly dm for more info Has the most useless Rude employees ever at Philadelphia airport never again will I fly with them ! 😤 You all work hard at making sure things flow smoothly. Keeping positive. we are boarding now but have yet to depart. Thanks for the response. I totally understand the weather. Just frustrated. Thanks! tell them to get on that, please. I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved gate agents are now working with everyone to resolve connecting flight issues which is my concern 5534. That\\'s the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled. Now 5534 is on 1hr delay Thx to gate agt John Pascucci for finding us a flight from CLT to PVD after our original one was Cancelled Flightled 1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one. the Gate Agent still hasn\\'t mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious. YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 please don\\'t go to the check in process uses at #MCO. It\\'s an absolute disaster. how about a phone # to talk to a real person? over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us I gave up I\\'ve been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way? lack of communication with other offices, the customer, yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers to be fucking up as badly as u do provides you the best logistics experience for people all over India. #Mumbai #Surat #NaviMumbai after last night in Charlotte NC I\\'m seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves. hi! Could you protect me on US 445 just in case? Still on ground with no checked luggage, but still a chance I can make original great but that still does not help me.. hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go why didn\\'t you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight #passengersLose I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after my luggage was delayed. I\\'m looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it... stranded in cold Texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways Thanks. “@USAirways: Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We\\'re sorry for the delay to your flight.” 325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... Fuck you not even on your dime and free tickets. #worsttraveldayever disappointment? Making own arrangements for me my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening. thank you thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons. 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help now no hotel. not flying with you again I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now! traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover. missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I\\'ll choose wiser next time I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue. half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming on the phone now. looks like global Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number. already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers. your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again that link leads to a website that won\\'t open on a cell phone. Good job, shocking that your airline is folding. My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I\\'d be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact? No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I\\'ve landed but was suppose to land at 5 ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn\\'t make up for it my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She\\'s only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways 👿 she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home 👠👠👠 (3 heel clicks) flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don\\'t have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening? Shout out to the red-headed gate agent for flt 3389 from DCA to CHS at 7:10 tonight. Didn\\'t get her name but she was great! I\\'m sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour Dude named Shaquille at the desk in Charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her Awesome USAir, TYSVM Thank you! that would be lovely! You have great people working in your organization. Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful. hey let flight 1874get to the gate hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board me too. Me too. a flight update doesn\\'t help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑 TYVM USAir, Happy Night@ thanks! It\\'s hectic for everyone but their actions don\\'t represent the company well IMO Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..??? NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious I\\'m sure you don\\'t but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won\\'t come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks. not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. Sad for others who didn\\'t get back bc of scheduling problems. how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers Will do. I appreciate the response. how long are billing cycles on hold for 1:23. All because they won\\'t let me use a companion voucher online and no one has been at all helpful.

They will not credit you if you\\'re delayed continues to win: I\\'ve never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh. - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a would-be 5 hr trip. You\\'ll never touch my pets again. don\\'t worry you won\\'t steal my money again why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?! pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter It\\'s not what happens to us that matters...It\\'s our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA. I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned. we done it with 1 truck... No biggie 😄 and have put me in bad mood. I haven\\'t been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_- flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW.

Am I rebooked on another flight? great, thanks! awesome. Thanks! my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What\\'s going on? extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy. robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow. said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that? Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff I\\'m not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place. can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM. Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks! I\\'d like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems. my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal? origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level. When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded? I know. Just a little cold weather humor. None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary. that doesn\\'t really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification... this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system. thanks!

Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx Sounds like a date! I\\'m frustrated by all of the attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service You\\'ve misunderstood. WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, \"NO.\" Flight 35. I\\'m on my way. car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait Thanks so much! “@AmericanAir: We hope you enjoy the #WinterWeather and brought your warm coat and gloves, Maria!” Yup! New beanie what weather sun is out so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from I was told a few days over the phone - but it\\'s well past that. I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight. It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn\\'t care 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me? The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour. I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I\\'m now out of extra meds and diapers for baby. I sure do. I\\'m running version 3.10.0 you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency you 2 together are the best part of flying! over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled. I\\'m done with you. FYI...call stilling getting dropped. After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!! how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored. what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won\\'t even answer the dang phone! 800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can\\'t talk to humans. I want to speak to a human being! !! This is not an obscene request! no response to DM or email yet. customer service? should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket! Thank you.....you do the same!! you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response. Hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words! Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW... now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help! what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don\\'t follow me why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless we\\'ve already made other arrangements ourselves. thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future. why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren\\'t even worth $200? stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal no thanks. As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible. sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM. Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today. aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers Mold on my flight?!?

Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO. Thanks for the quick response - it\\'s appreciated! Thank you for responding...My laptop is in my bag and I need it for work. I am worried. The file code is UTEVGW. guess that\\'s what I get for bragging on you.

I need help getting to DFW or IAH!! my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane? US Air 597 jfk to phx is there any way to manually add gift cards to an ex-EU ticket( AA metal on long haul,BA for intra-EU)? I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on... once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance? no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. \"We will take off soon.\" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW. thanks for the recommendation. We\\'ve been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago. I\\'ll be sticking with in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service. does it show that we are on the same plane? although you have no control of the weather, you came through with a great customer service there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible. ...2/2 doesn\\'t help me. As I already have a booked flight that I can\\'t use can\\'t change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2 depends on the terminal, what\\' the best option? Arrive C, depart A. Breakfast burrito is what I\\'m craving..

Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn\\'t leaving till 1220 thank you AA, this is how I always start my vacations how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do? Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. has always been accommodating. flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I\\'m hungry! Get me to DFW! Yes, thank you. Just not how I wanted to start my vacation! my flight number is 3M 50 your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight. when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft.. I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏 thank you for replying. Trying to figure out how to get from there from DFW don\\'t merge with an airline that ain\\'t ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy #NeedCoffee Yes, obviously! It just stinks that 4pm is the one option when she was supposed to fly at 7AM YESTERDAY. “@AmericanAir: Good morning, Tamara. We\\'ll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.”#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset made it! Thanks AA! how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci why thank you!! Yayayay!! That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated we\\'re all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours. Thank you for being so responsive on Twitter. Truly impressive. flight BA1551 departing tomorrow (wednesday) - not Cancelled Flightled but how can anyone make it to the airport in this weather? She\\'s on Manch to Charlotte Fl 4628 Told her she could get on a 4pm flight to West Palm Beach. Nothing earlier? #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!! it\\'s flight 5348 You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying! The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again. Unknowledgeable staff. please can you tell me why DFW has a weather advisory and RDU does not? the entire state of NC has shut down from ice snow! Thank you, Much appreciated. I\\'d like the 11c I originally tried for - again, happy to pay the difference when will you be issuing a weather advisory for RDU?? the entire state of NC has shut down from the overnight winter storm. I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to? mission accomplished today, Thank you! zoom in on the sauce and potatoes. This stuff is vile. And I mean vile. when will the merging of miles between you and be complete? Wasn\\'t it this month? - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I\\'ve flown almost all of them when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route? 2 hour flight, could use some love! What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better. I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome. She seems a little preoccupied - that\\'s why I\\'m bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer. She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside. Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts \"why this person was talking to her\". yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still \"Now Boarding\"... fantastic thanks! Will try and tweet a photo of the view excellent! Love you guys! If it is first class I\\'ll hug ya\\'ll! See you shortly! Thanks, have emailed them. How long should I expect for a response? They said it works 80-90% of the time, DFW security entrance C26. Before/after pre-check, whereas I paid for the service. 3659 from SGF -&gt; DFW. You might want to clear off the ice for the planes landing. 😳 great job TYR ground crew...now let\\'s get this bird outta here!!! Tell flight 3200 to wait on me...be there in 45 mikes! stated before I\\'m not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site. One question.. my wife didn\\'t get the bonus. Should I call about it today? but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform. Good morning! Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning?? Yes I do bit you don\\'t follow me so I can\\'t DM you as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated. again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i\\'m on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding. 140 characters aren\\'t enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are was hoping for 8A if possible, for some frozen views along the way! ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up your cabin \\'thank you\\' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time. really? That\\'s it? Not even a \"we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time\" Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401 Thank you. She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don\\'t have time to do that. #terrible hi when will your next set of flights be out for next year from Dublin??? Had my flight changed from US Airways to you, now I can\\'t get two seats together. Can you help? The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people having trouble Flight Booking Problems a seat on US84 11 March, operated by AA. Neither airline\\'s website will allow seat selection? thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance. I fly weekly with you and haven\\'t seen one I would love to say the same but it\\'s not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll Uwon\\'t allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service? oh I will, AA on speed dial Thanks, Was just about to book a flight to UK using but after reading this exchange, there\\'s no way. I\\'ve sent Amazing to watch (who travels with celebs all over the world) show the youth of America who *not* to fly with. travel week, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, \"if you want to learn more about the merger press 1\", delay my connector in Chicago #deice Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction. Horrible service Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn\\'t help at all. That’s a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn’t understand e-mail 101. thanks! Flight 2160 today. Great crew! \"Thank you for contacting American. The email address you have written to is an unmonitored account” Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful? If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using \"weather\" the motor that usually starts the engine is broke and ground crew failed to do it on time, per pilot #maintenance is rising like the sun at DCA this morning. members have the best view. #avgeek she has the guy u served drinks 2 til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women there\\'s a lot of talks and no doing. MIA-SFO on a 20+ year old plane #nonewplanes #old #shame and get it together, perfect combination for delays and Cancelled Flightlations Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future ! Thank you for the info! Changes need to be made over the phone, correct? Is there any way an AA agent can call me directly? are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you! especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space. so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what? this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull! just need to know why it wasn\\'t done like it was promised it would yesterday too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should\\'ve bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning did that yesterday. On the phone with them now re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you. Statement wasn\\'t sent yesterday like Jeanine said. After I even called last night as well. Again, excellent service So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges? 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline. that\\'s what is on my ticket and my confirmation email. Anything else? I\\'m flying into DCA my bag is at IAD. I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work. I will call the number when I land 😭 try this. DPDFPP face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can\\'t do...... just wow Regina just told me I can\\'t file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel. So until I get to DC argg I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA\\'s response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!! record number is BPDFPP. You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes.... Embassy Suites 13341 Woodland Park Drive Herndon, Virginia, 20171 US +1-703-464-0200 is non existent and I will take this as far as needed.Why hide behind a corporate logo? Provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from... it isn\\'t good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by Lol great answer.. “@AmericanAir: Our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience.” Super Spring Tides and “Tide of The Century” Drawing tourists to French and U.K coasts: Ps, I was right. yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I\\'m still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX what\\'s the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in. would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep. merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues You don\\'t have those abilities anywhere! Not at the ticket counter, at cust service, or online. That\\'s why we\\'re done here. when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not? needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people a massive line. People need to catch their flights! I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances. the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing. Just wow oh no she left the counter and went downstairs. Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter. Of course you are because that\\'s your companies job! You guys failed at it in the first place. Upgrade me and then we\\'ll talk. Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead. you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd .@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue. Flight 1679 (N76200) prepares for flight at before departing for .@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded... I\\'m trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error Thanks, both airlines said that it is located at AA Detroit. Also was informed that it flew with AA, which shouldn\\'t matter. We did talk with Delta for about hour over phone, and I got a number from Delta that they asked to give to AA, which I did. Policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. Flying is not for... already did- reply was \"sorry. we believe this to be fair.\" as a journalist writing an article on my trip i will include this leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling. I\\'ve been trying to change a Thursday flight and there\\'s a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn\\'t helping I saw an American 767 in old colours at on Saturday! Was surprised to see! We all did! Skipper\\'s walk-around too Plane Veers Off Runway at Icy Dallas Airport Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn\\'t work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system. thanks for the canned reply. just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen?? no; I just expect a higher level of customer service for the flight crews to give us accurate information or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled! I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there. I\\'ve emailed your customer service twice now who don\\'t seem to care. no I\\'ve since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost! nothing, you have done enough. I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection! Such a suprise! New vanity kit set for frequent travellers 😀 thank you AA! gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!! lovely flight back from MIA to LHR - great crew - thanks I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or please help! offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you\\'re supposed to provide over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled. I\\'m done with you. another generic response guys? Cmon. You\\'re terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp. worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude 😡😡 thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible.. I did twice.got a letter back saying that your company \"doesn\\'t issue refunds for phone bills\" help!phone will be shut off oh, yeah. I guess those are two different things. 3 am does weird things to my brain. Thanks again! xox yes. No one is answering and I\\'m on a train TY! But, their site says \" Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ...\" its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them just hoping/praying for a safe flight. They\\'ve had to stop and de-ice our plane yet again😞 after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to\"arrange pick up\"in argentina,claiming tollfree: won\\'t reimburse me. Help! pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine. i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don\\'t like myself? I responded. Your info different than your customer service line done will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible that\\'s absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can\\'t immediately call back when disconnected??? will do. I also passed the website around to other passengers. my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they\\'d call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!! *does = doesn\\'t Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It\\'s a very small item. what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service! \"The wheel was broken when we got it. We swear.\" Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available??? I\\'ll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru I ❤️ these earrings!! checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas. Baggage was only checked to ORD. and btwn gate a8 a15 I lost a diamond earring #dayjustgotWORSE! Pls have maintenance look for it!! we then had to deplane, and change planes. you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour. but your flight crews ground crews have handled situation well. Texting notification let me catch a few winks during delay. Thx! I hope so. IAH to DFW to OKC has turned out to be a LONG trip today and I have to work tomorrow. I understand that but I\\'m hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag. yeah, buy me a plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation. is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be. hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help? I DM\\'d you thank you! My lost item was located at ORD and is being returned to me. Why doesn\\'t provide a means for dialogue? What is the fear that drives this decision? #worstcustomerserviceever 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing. it\\'s not only my bag...it\\'s the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time. Why doesn\\'t allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service? #worstcustomerserviceever it\\'s not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. 👎😡✈️ #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday... and I forgot about that lounge!😂 Thanks!

Any idea on how much longer? - thanks. She submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice Thanks! they responded. I can\\'t respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever thanks you always be my airline of choice when possible gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight? .@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep?

A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I\\'d have missed funeral. Nice try I heard your crew whisper \"she\\'s still at the hotel, she probably doesn\\'t think she has to work until tomorrow\" do you have hand sanitizer in the bathrooms on your flights? I\\'m at the airport right now and your people didn\\'t know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.

WOW we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don\\'t think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting If it\\'s in my backpack, why do I need to see agent? I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.

After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules. help! Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn\\'t even try to help! any idea why flight 5392 from HSV to DFW tomorrow Cancelled Flightled about 45 minutes ago? thanks. I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed. Guess all delays are not a bad thing. the issue wasn\\'t a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn\\'t let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message. Did the policy change? I\\'ve seen people with hamsters and rabbits before. thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held. Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.

No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I\\'m not. I\\'ve been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous my 2498 to CLT left the gate. What is next for CLT. Need help you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) if it I have not rebooked didn\\'t get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled is that the flight for tomorrow? “@AmericanAir: Thanks for the shout-out, Candace! Enjoy the ride.” Always! I adore American Airlines! Without notifying though? “@AmericanAir: We don\\'t like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us.\" Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold We\\'d #love to have you on board with us! here I come Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5? how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money im still on hold... you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It\\'s because your airline sucks. Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?! Do we get a class discount on your wifi? I will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 Am? #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this.

SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort.. needs an entire customer service overhaul would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money? why do you continually play the \"according to federal regulations\" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service... can I send you my trusted traveler ID to add to my reservation for tsa pre? thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport????? the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros. They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW. He thanks you.

Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service.

No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours. Got a call but was hung up on. been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10... Any advice? Chicago seen from seat 6A, AA 1620. So far a great ride! On to PDX! thanks. Delivery status?? I don\\'t believe it\\'s acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time not be notified. Apparently that\\'s standard. I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn\\'t allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address? our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call? here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn\\'t the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! I had booked online but unable to Cancelled Flight online. But finally got thru. Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight! on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I\\'d be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation. This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left. #customerservice our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we\\'ll make it. been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? We don\\'t mind the fee! We were told we can\\'t change name on ticket at all. Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time. the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn\\'t reflect the use of a voucher so whats the hold up on flight 4302? Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion. Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren\\'t able to accommodate. Thank you. After being patient about my \"delayed\" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable! I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service. flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event. Sent to three gates in the night Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive) Not okay. Since you couldn\\'t put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline. Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I\\'d have to take a 2nd day off work. been airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said \"we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch\"! Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call. can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights? I\\'ve tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST. I\\'m having no luck -help! Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour. You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday. Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows. thanks unacceptable. It\\'s clear losing just one customer doesn\\'t matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take will do on another airline that\\'s more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted? THANK YOU!!! 👍👍👍👍👍 Uhmmm we need down in Dallas,Tx for his tour 😫😫😫 is there a way to reserve my dog’s flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline!

No I\\'m not patient. Why don\\'t you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess. no standby line update online or on app either is troubling No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip.

You don\\'t care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn\\'t care about my sister maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling.

Could have voided the ticket since it was 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can\\'t get through. - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don\\'t care about their safety?

I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven\\'t strtd boarding. I know you are getting pummeled tonight we were one of the lucky out of just one more And gold status too. In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can\\'t reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do? was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they\\'re not and I continue to be lied to. won\\'t answer the reservation line! Nice service. We may be stuck... It\\'s not your agents; it\\'s your voice activated system that\\'s not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won\\'t be better for flight 750. thanks I\\'m on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest\\'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection? no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don\\'t see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven\\'t even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked Every last leg back to US says invalid I\\'m booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I\\'m good. Stay warm and safe. So plot thickens. We\\'re on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers.... 800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can\\'t talk to humans. what happened?? We didn\\'t get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight , to my surprise BA doesn\\'t have me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful Lets step it up , Okay ? Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help? Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho. Thank you for sending more details They\\'re pretty handy dandy. more info here: #LookforwardtoflywithAA aa223 being ignored FYI twice now I\\'ve tried the \"we\\'ll call you when someone is free\" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up. that\\'s the number I called -it wouldn\\'t let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can\\'t figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed. I didn\\'t miss my flight. American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault. Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled. Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund. Have children and need to make plans now DM sent. Answer me please I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 #AmericanAirlines is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand I\\'ve never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline. you Cancelled Flightled my wife\\'s flight and she has to call but your service won\\'t even let us. Going on 7 hours now. it shouldn\\'t happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items American Airlines. all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These issues are based on negligence. the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet. I just DMed you why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ? Good luck at DFW this evening AA! so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we\\'ll have heard from an AA rep at that point. on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx! flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 😳 seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in I have followed and dm\\'d you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service. To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am. I don\\'t like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr. CS sucks. just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams. Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs enroute to approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight. checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives? Very poor. how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293 I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on for $382 but their mileage program sucks. Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293 never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It\\'s on us air, so I don\\'t think I\\'ll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks. my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can\\'t get an agent. They\\'ve called her back to be put on hold then discnct.Any help? My wife infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect? Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can\\'t do both. Can you help? anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy. Why can\\'t you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick \"Goodbye\" Very Sad! VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service Please help! I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I\\'m providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me? already did an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours.

But I have to work though 😒 I\\'m really mad about the situation whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won\\'t stray anymore. I\\'m talking about you between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer... I need help with a reservation purchased on but operated on can\\'t get through on the 800# flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. What do I do next? Pls advise. #HELP how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight! my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund? thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome I can\\'t choose a seat online because I booked on ??? #SMH it wasn\\'t really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot. Makes a person paranoid. \"overweight\" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let\\'s call it what it is. How,about more@Blacklist too!! at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF? Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.

Won\\'t be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning. that\\'s ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses. spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least. Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new\\'airplanes are used. They are gr8 thanks for the show! 👍 well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA. Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible! see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights! , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing! Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes? Unmoving? this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can\\'t staff a call center Great seats on this aircraft! Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven\\'t even seen one plane😡 Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal! 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at representing #yourstoryhere a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on! Are you now flying 763s to Madrid from JFK or is this DFW/ORD? Huge !! The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles. who\\'s your pick for best picture? I don\\'t want to board your airline until I know we have 3 more passengers with me There are two more reservation numbers no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs 8:30 departure? Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK? , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca easier \"here for you\" as in, yeah, we\\'ll tweet platitudes at you so you\\'ll think our Twitter bot cares? Or.... #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded. You have the worst customer service of any airlines I\\'ve ever encountered. Flat out awful why don\\'t you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you\\'ve got DONE!! thank you so much!! Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool untrue 24 hrs 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I\\'ve landed in PHL. Now 30 mins counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this. delivered mom\\'s delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, hr today. Still no bag. #AA Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight. Can we just leave now w/o the food won\\'t eat anyway? this is awful customer service. everything\\'s good now brothaaaaaa its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired 740pm wheels up to be exact. I\\'m sending a DM. translation: we don\\'t reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. \\'Cause we don\\'t care. OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally! no, you couldn\\'t care less. That\\'s why their customer service is run by bots pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home! you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call. yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would\\'ve cost me $30 extra per seat. we need a miracle please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids 3198 to AEX. Is it still going? i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning! finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps c17 CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure? Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare. I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook? i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me? Close down it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let\\'s get another great leg too tonight! i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That\\'s really all I ever wanted to begin with. AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers\\' bags. I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again. you know nothing about customer service and I\\'ll make sure everyone knows it I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable. now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight yeah that\\'s not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped. I did 50 times and no one was helpful I\\'m missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn\\'t want to talk us My flight to was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key GRU) for sorting it out! I haven\\'t been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven\\'t heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting.... I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI is taking. I know it\\'s US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home. Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days.. Same as yesterday\\'s Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful! big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here. Thanks again for a sleepless night. really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and are useles Hi AA friends! My sis\\'s flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options? is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg? I have not. There\\'s no option for even getting a call back! tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool. all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I\\'m stranded at the airport for the night... wow. how hard is it to have catering ready to go? Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option? this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day. I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz. flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we\\'re not boarding because we\\'re waiting for catering? my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again. versus in Customer Service? Who will win! For Me is a convenience to a trip to Cali agents refuse to help, \"too busy\" need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight? Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck you should be contacting her for a refund - dm me and I will provide phone number ah if only we could get through. We\\'ve tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced. of course it wasn\\'t your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help! pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault trying to check in for flight. On line not working agents too busy to take my call. yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying \"standby\" understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel? I\\'m on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?. AA I need a Hail Mary.

Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads? why does your customer service line say \"we are experiencing high call volume\" and then spontaneously hangup on the person? well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up try paying overtime and bring in more people What\\'s the best way to check on any delays or Cancelled Flightlations for my flight out of DFW on Tuesday? big UPS to Newark airport staff D.Dean.
